  abstract = {Bird nests often consist of stronger materials to maintain nest structure and a softer layer of lining materials to reduce heat loss. We studied whether early learning affected the use of nest materials by cross-fostering between two tit species with similar breeding ecology, the blue tit, \${$<\$$}em\${$>\$$}Cyanistes caeruleus\${$<\$$}/em\${$>\$$}, and the great tit, \${$<\$$}em\${$>\$$}Parus major\${$<\$$}/em\${$>\$$}, in a woodland area provided with nestboxes in Norway. In both species, only the female builds the nest. From previous studies, we know that early social learning affects a number of traits in these birds, including song repertoire, mate choice, foraging behaviour and nest site choice. Nests of the two species are similar but blue tits use more feathers than great tits. This was confirmed in the present study; however, female blue tits raised by great tit foster parents also supplied their nest with feathers, and female great tits raised by blue tits used few feathers. The only treatment effect was that fewer feathers were found in nests of cross-fostered females in both species than in nests of controls. This may have been caused by time and energetic constraints during nest building because cross-fostered birds seemed to forage less efficiently than controls. The amount of hair was slightly greater in blue tits than in great tits, but it was not affected by the cross-fostering either. We conclude that no cultural transmission was found in the use of lining materials in the nest of the two species, perhaps because young birds hatch after their parents have stopped constructing the nest.}

It is currently debated which cognitive abilities support cumulative culture, but behavior copying is one of the main abilities proposed. One important source of contention is the presence or absence of behavior copying in our closest living relatives, non-human great apes (apes) \textendash{} especially given that their behavior does not show clear signs of cumulation. Those who claim that apes copy behavior often base this claim on the existence of stable ape cultures in the wild (Whiten et al. 1999; van Schaik et al. 2003). We developed an individual-based model to test whether ape cultural patterns can both emerge and stabilize in the entire absence of any behavior copying, but only allowing for a well-supported alternative social learning mechanism, namely socially-mediated reinnovation, where only the frequency of reinnovation is under social influence, but the form of the behavior is not. Our model reflects wild ape life conditions, including physiological and behavioral individual needs, demographic and spatial features, and the possible range of genetic and ecological variations between populations. Our results show that, under a wide range of realistic values of all model parameters, we fully reproduce the most defining features of wild ape cultural patterns (Whiten et al. 1999; van Schaik et al. 2003). Overall, our results show that ape cultures can both emerge and stabilize without behavior copying. Ape cultures are therefore unable to pinpoint behavior copying abilities, lending support to the notion that behavior copying is, among apes, unique in the human lineage.}

Here we study turnover in ranked lists and identify where the turnover departs from neutral model predictions to detect transmission biases in three different domains: color terms usage in English language 20th century books, popularity of early (1880-1930) and recent (1960-2010) USA baby names, and musical preferences of users of the Web site Last.fm. To help characterize the type of transmission bias, we modify the neutral model to include a content-based bias and two context-based biases (conformity and anti-conformity). How these modified models match real data helps us to infer, from population scale observations, when cultural transmission is biased, and, to some extent, what kind of biases are operating at individual level. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Birdsong is an excellent model system for understanding sequence learning of complex fine motor skills, but we know surprisingly little how the motor pool controlling the syrinx is organized and how MU recruitment drives changes in vocal output. Here we combine measurements of syringeal muscle innervation ratios with muscle stress and an in vitro syrinx preparation to estimate MU size distribution and the control resolution of fundamental frequency (fo), a key vocal parameter, in zebra finches. We show that syringeal muscles have extremely small MUs, with 50\% innervating [\$\textbackslash leq\$] 3, and 13 - 17\% innervating a single muscle fiber. Combined with the lowest specific stress (5 mN/mm2) known to skeletal vertebrate muscle, small force steps by the major fo controlling muscle provide control of 50 mHz to 4.2 Hz steps per MU. We show that the song system has the highest motor control resolution possible in the vertebrate nervous system and suggest this evolved due to strong selection on fine gradation of vocal output. Furthermore, we propose that high-resolution motor control was a key feature contributing to the radiation of songbirds that allowed diversification of song and speciation by vocal space expansion.}

In PNAS, MacCallum et al. (3) present an experimental approach to study how music evolves, by encoding sounds into programs that can evolve via random mutation and recombination. Using computer programs to study evolution is of course not new (4), but in this case selection was at the hands of people, who listened to the musical phenotype of these programs over the Internet and scored them according to their personal preference. Within a population of ``looping polyphonic sound sequences''\textemdash or ``loops,'' for short\textemdash those sequences that generated higher ratings by users were given more offspring, and their genetic materials recombined. In this manner, the prevailing music in the population changed over many generations. However, did the music get any better?

In PNAS, MacCallum et al. (3) present an experimental approach to study how music evolves, by encoding sounds into programs that can evolve via random mutation and recombination. Using computer programs to study evolution is of course not new (4), but in this case selection was at the hands of people, who listened to the musical phenotype of these programs over the Internet and scored them according to their personal preference. Within a population of ``looping polyphonic sound sequences''\textemdash{} or ``loops,'' for short\textemdash{} those sequences that generated higher ratings by users were given more offspring, and their genetic materials recombined. In this manner, the prevailing music in the population changed over many generations. However, did the music get any better? To assess this, the authors sample loops from the entire evolutionary trajectory and ask a different set of consumers (not those who selected the loops in the original experiment) to rate the quality of the \textbackslash ldots [\$\textbackslash carriagereturn\$][1]1E-mail: adami\{at\}msu.edu.

  abstract = {Zipf's law, which states that the probability of an observation is inversely proportional to its rank, has been observed in many domains. While there are models that explain Zipf's law in each of them, those explanations are typically domain specific. Recently, methods from statistical physics were used to show that a fairly broad class of models does provide a general explanation of Zipf's law. This explanation rests on the observation that real world data is often generated from underlying causes, known as latent variables. Those latent variables mix together multiple models that do not obey Zipf's law, giving a model that does. Here we extend that work both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we provide a far simpler and more intuitive explanation of Zipf's law, which at the same time considerably extends the class of models to which this explanation can apply. Furthermore, we also give methods for verifying whether this explanation applies to a particular dataset. Empirically, these advances allowed us extend this explanation to important classes of data, including word frequencies (the first domain in which Zipf's law was discovered), data with variable sequence length, and multi-neuron spiking activity.},

  abstract = {\${$<\$$}p\${$>\$$}In most songbirds, the processes of song learning and territory establishment overlap in the early life and a young bird usually winds up with songs matching those of his territorial neighbors in his first breeding season. In the present study, we examined the relationships among the timing of territory establishment, the pattern of song learning and territorial success in a sedentary population of song sparrows (\textbackslash emphMelospiza melodia). Males in this population tend to learn their songs from their neighbors and consequently they show high song sharing with neighbors and use these shared songs preferentially in interactions with them. Males also show significant variation in the timing of territory establishment, ranging from their natal summer to the next spring. Using a three-year dataset, we found that the timing of territory establishment did not systematically affect the composition of the song repertoire of the tutee: early establishers and late establishers learned equally as much from their primary tutors and had a similar number of tutors and similar repertoire sizes, nor did timing of territory establishment affect subsequent survival on territory. Therefore, the song-learning program of song sparrows seems versatile enough to lead to high song sharing even for birds that establish territories relatively late.\${$<\$$}/p\${$>\$$}}

Whether bird's own song is represented and recognized as a special category in adult birds, however, is unclear. If birds respond differently to their own songs when these are played back to them, this would be evidence for auditory self-recognition. To test this possibility, we presented song sparrow males (Melospiza melodia) playbacks of their own songs or stranger songs and measured aggressive responses as well as type matching. We find no evidence of behavioural discrimination of bird's own song relative to the (non-matching) stranger song. These findings cast doubt on an earlier proposal that song sparrows display auditory self-recognition and support the common assumption in playback experiments that bird's own song is perceived as stranger song.}

Population structuring and spatial behaviour are key determinants of individuals' observed social behaviour, but quantifying these spatial components alongside multiple other drivers remains difficult due to data scarcity and analytical complexity. We used a 43-year dataset detailing a wild red deer population to investigate how individuals' spatial behaviours drive social network positioning, while simultaneously assessing other potential contributing factors. Using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) multi-matrix animal models, we demonstrate that social network positions are shaped by two-dimensional landscape locations, pairwise space sharing, individual range size, and spatial and temporal variation in population density, alongside smaller but detectable impacts of a selection of individual-level phenotypic traits. These results indicate strong, multifaceted spatiotemporal structuring in this society, emphasising the importance of considering multiple spatial components when investigating the causes and consequences of sociality.},

The purpose of this study was to explore beliefs about depression among Afghans residing in San Diego County, California using Cultural Consensus Analysis. Using the prescribed mixed-method approach, we employed results from in-depth interviews to develop a culturally meaningful questionnaire about depression. Consensus analysis of responses to questionnaire items from 93 Afghans (50 men, 43 women) indicates shared beliefs that associates depression causality with mild traumatic experiences and post-resettlement stressors; symptomatology to include culturally salient idioms of distress; and, treatment selections ranging from lay techniques to professional care. Divergence between genders occurred most in the symptoms subdomain with women associating depression with more somatic items. This study contributes to understanding the etiology of, and cultural responses to depression among this population, which is critical to improving practice with Afghan refugees.

  abstract = {Relatively little empirical attention has been paid to understanding how refugees conceptualize depression and how this concept varies between genders. The purpose of this study was to explore beliefs about depression among Afghans residing in San Diego County, California using Cultural Consensus Analysis. Using the prescribed mixed-method approach, we employed results from in-depth interviews to develop a culturally meaningful questionnaire about depression. Consensus analysis of responses to questionnaire items from 93 Afghans (50 men, 43 women) indicates shared beliefs that associates depression causality with mild traumatic experiences and post-resettlement stressors; symptomatology to include culturally salient idioms of distress; and, treatment selections ranging from lay techniques to professional care. Divergence between genders occurred most in the symptoms subdomain with women associating depression with more somatic items. This study contributes to understanding the etiology of, and cultural responses to depression among this population, which is critical to improving practice with Afghan refugees.

  abstract = {Vocal communication systems have a set of rules that govern the arrangement of acoustic signals, broadly defined as 'syntax'. However, there is a limited understanding of potentially shared or analogous rules across vocal displays in different taxa. Recent work on songbirds has investigated syntax using network-based modelling. This technique quantifies features such as connectivity (adjacent signals in a sequence) and recurring patterns. Here, we apply network-based modelling to the complex, hierarchically structured songs of humpback whales (\textbackslash emphMegaptera novaeangliae) from east Australia. Given the song's annual evolving pattern and the cultural conformity of males within a population, network modelling captured the patterns of multiple song types over 13 consecutive years. Song arrangements in each year displayed clear 'small-world' network structure, characterized by clusters of highly connected sounds. Transitions between these connected sounds further suggested a combination of both structural stability and variability. Small-world network structure within humpback songs may facilitate the characteristic and persistent vocal learning observed. Similar small-world structures and transition patterns are found in several birdsong displays, indicating common syntactic patterns among vocal learning in multiple taxa. Understanding the syntactic rules governing vocal displays in multiple, independently evolving lineages may indicate what rules or structural features are important to the evolution of complex communication, including human language.}

Support for models with a social transmission component was 6 to 23 orders of magnitude greater than for models without. The spatial and temporal distribution of sand lance, a prey species, was also important in predicting the rate of acquisition. Our results, coupled with existing knowledge about song traditions, show that this species can maintain multiple independently evolving traditions in its populations. These insights strengthen the case that cetaceans represent a peak in the evolution of nonhuman culture, independent of the primate lineage.},

  abstract = {Several dimensions of shape, such as curvature or taper, can be regarded as extending from a singular (S) or 0 value (e.g., a straight contour with 0 curvature or parallel contours with a 0 angle of convergence) to an infinity of non-singular (NS) values (e.g., curves and non-parallel contours). As orientation in depth is varied, an S value remains S, and a NS value will vary but will remain NS. Infant and adult human participants viewed pairs of geons where one member had an S and the other had a NS value on a given shape dimension, e.g., a cylinder vs. a cone. Both adults and infants looked first, and adults looked longer at the NS geons.

As orientation in depth is varied, an S value remains S, and a NS value will vary but will remain NS. Infant and adult human participants viewed pairs of geons where one member had an S and the other had a NS value on a given shape dimension, e.g., a cylinder vs. a cone.

  abstract = {The late Stephen Jay Gould, at one point in his wide ranging studies, decided to look into the early publications of Alfred Kinsey to see if he could find insights into Kinsey's later work in sexology. Kinsey began his career as a taxonomist of gall wasps. Gould located and dusted off the (Harvard) Widener Library copy of a Kinsey monograph on wasps from the 1930s, and found graffiti on the title page: ''Why don't you write about something more interesting, Al?'' (Gould 1985, p.157). Elisabeth Lloyd captured public attention with her 2005 publication of The Case of the Female Orgasm: Bias in the Science of Evolution. Orgasms are interesting. The New York Times reviewed the book in its Tuesday Science section (a section that Gould had read religiously). Lloyd was immediately invited to chat about her book with Barbara Walters and colleagues in NBC's morning program The View. Saturday Night Live joked that the book was a ''real departure for the Hardy Boys.'' (The Hardy Boys was a series of mystery novels for adolescents with titles like ''The Case of the Cosmic Kidnapping.'') The comparison of Lloyd's book to a mystery novel is more insightful than the stances taken by some of her reviewers. (My tardiness in completing this review led me to examine Lloyd's early reviewers.) They take the topic of the book to be the female orgasm itself, rather than its ''case.'' The case of the female orgasm is the history of the theorizing and argumentation about the evolutionary origin and maintenance of the trait. Once we rec-ognize the inconsistency of the facts about female orgasm with the early adaptationist theories about its origin, the first mystery is how those theories could have been accepted in the first place. The facts are that female orgasms are developmentally related to male orgasms, with common embryological primordia for penis and clitoris and apparently homological reflexes during orgasm: contractions in the muscular floor of the pelvis with a 0.8 s frequency. But these similarities in the internal, homological relations between the male and female origins contrast with the environmental causes of the reflex in each sex. Male orgasms are stimulated by sexual intercourse, and by masturbatory friction on the phallus (the penis in males) that imitates intercourse. Female orgasms are similarly stimulated by friction on the phallus (the clitoris in females), but human anatomy rarely allows this to happen during simple intercourse. Masturbatory orgasms usually involve direct stimulation of the clitoris, which is not an imitation of intercourse. Lloyd calls this ''the orgasm/intercourse discrepancy.'' The case is, in large part, how the discrepancy could have been ignored for so long by so scholars who professed expertise. The earliest adaptationist theories are almost ludicrously inadequate. They assumed that the selective advantage of male and female orgasms was identical\textemdash fertilization enhanced by the fact that intercourse causes orgasms in both sexes. Lloyd documents these failures, and the less ludicrous but still (in Lloyd's view) flawed arguments in support of more recent adaptationist theories that acknowledge the discrepancy. She favors Donald Symon's ''byproduct'' theory according to which the female orgasm is a continuing developmental byproduct of selection for the male orgasm (Symons 1979). In the face of the many failures of adaptationist theories, several reviewers find it irresistible to offer new explanations of their own (Chivers 2007; Eschler 2005; Judson 2005). Some do so because they disagree with Lloyd's criticisms of adaptationist methodology. But others just seem to get caught up in the excitement of an evolutionary mystery. After all, we are all experts about sex, aren't we? Well, no. The early adaptationist theorists (all of them male) assumed that female orgasm matched male orgasm in key aspects. Females were said to be exhausted and somnolent following a single orgasm, and female orgasms were said to be best produced by missionary-position copulation. (Readers can construct for themselves the just-so stories that explain how these properties enhance fitness.) The only acknowledgement of difference between men and women in these early theories was the claim that female orgasms take longer to produce than male orgasms. Ironically, this too is wrong. Masturbatory orgasms are produced equally quickly in males and females. It is easy to see why the early theorists thought otherwise, given their background belief that female orgasms were best produced by missionary intercourse. The most embarrassing aspect of the early theories was not the theorists' ignorance of female sexuality; that was typical of the time. It was that the theorists themselves cited the very sexological research that had proven the differences between male and female orgasm, without recognizing its implications. For this reason, Lloyd concludes that nave androcentrism was as much to blame as overreaching adaptationism for the acceptance of the early theories. Lloyd discusses 20 theories (19 adaptationist plus the byproduct theory) in historical order, almost always in the context of the sexological knowledge available when each theory was proposed. She is careful to relativize even the byproduct theory to the evidence at hand. Some adaptationist reviewers argue that Lloyd may have shown that there is a shortage of evidence on the adaptationist side, but that it is an error to infer the correctness of a byproduct theory from a mere lack of evidence for adaptationist theories (Barash 2005; Judson 2005). This is unfair. Lloyd does not argue from a lack of evidence. She offers positive evidence on the byproduct side\textemdash the embryological evidence together with the sexological evidence documenting the discrepancy. (Later adaptationist theories try to sidestep the discrepancy, but Lloyd offers arguments against each of these.) If this evi-dence didn't exist\textemdash if female orgasms occurred in completely different body parts from male orgasms, for example\textemdash then the byproduct view would be greatly weakened. Adaptationists often treat developmental byproduct theories as being founded on a mere lack of evidence. This is because the two sides of this debate have different standards for what counts as evidence. But developmental evidence is evidence, at least from the developmental viewpoint. There are definite gaps in the available evidence regarding the fitness consequences of female orgasm, however. Lloyd eventually offers extensive suggestions of how the 440 R. Amundson},

  abstract = {Individuals often differ consistently in behaviour across time and contexts, and such consistent behavioural differences are commonly described as personality. Personality can play a central role in social behaviour both in dyadic interactions and in social networks. We investigated whether explorative behaviour, as proxy of personality of territorial male great tits (Parus major), predicts their own and their neighbours' territorial responses towards simulated intruders. Several weeks prior to playback, subjects were taken from the wild to test their exploratory behaviour in a standard context in the laboratory. Exploratory behaviour provides a proxy of personality along a slow-fast explorer continuum. Upon release, males were radio-tracked and subsequently exposed to interactive playback simulating a more or a less aggressive territorial intruder (by either overlapping or alternating broadcast songs with the subjects' songs). At the same time, we radio-tracked a neighbour of the playback subject. Male vocal responses during playback and spatial movements after playback varied according to male explorative behaviour and playback treatment. Males with lower exploration scores approached the loudspeaker less, and sang more songs, shorter songs and songs with slower element rates than did males with higher exploration scores. Moreover, neighbour responses were related to the explorative behaviour of the subject receiving the playback but not to their own explorative behaviour. Our overall findings reveal for the first time how personality traits affect resource defence within a communication network providing new insights on the cause of variation in resource defence behaviour.},

  abstract = {The divergence of sexual signals is ultimately a coevolutionary process: while signals and preferences diverge between lineages, they must remain coordinated within lineages for matings to occur. Divergence in sexual signals makes a major contribution to evolving species barriers. Therefore, the genetic architecture underlying signal\textendash{} preference coevolution is essential to understanding speciation but remains largely unknown. In \textbackslash emphLaupala crickets where male song pulse rate and female pulse rate preferences have coevolved repeatedly and rapidly, we tested two contrasting hypotheses for the genetic architecture underlying signal\textendash{} preference coevolution: linkage disequilibrium between unlinked loci and genetic coupling (linkage disequilibrium resulting from pleiotropy of a shared locus or tight physical linkage). Through selective introgression and quantitative trait locus (QTL) fine mapping, we estimated the location of QTL underlying interspecific variation in both female preference and male pulse rate from the same mapping populations. Remarkably, map estimates of the pulse rate and preference loci are as close as 0.06 cM apart, the strongest evidence to date for genetic coupling between signal and preference loci. As the second pair of colocalizing signal and preference loci in the \textbackslash emphLaupala genome, our finding supports an intriguing pattern, pointing to a major role for genetic coupling in the quantitative evolution of a reproductive barrier and rapid speciation in \textbackslash emphLaupala. Owing to its effect on suppressing recombination, a coupled, quantitative genetic architecture offers a powerful and parsimonious genetic mechanism for signal\textendash{} preference coevolution and the establishment of positive genetic covariance on which the Fisherian runaway process of sexual selection relies.}

  abstract = {Speech and song have been transmitted orally for countless human generations, changing over time under the influence of biological, cognitive, and cultural pressures. Cross-cultural regularities and diversities in human song are thought to emerge from this transmission process, but testing how underlying mechanisms contribute to musical structures remains a key challenge. Here, we introduce an automatic online pipeline that streamlines large-scale cultural transmission experiments using a sophisticated and naturalistic modality: singing. We quantify the evolution of 3,424 melodies orally transmitted across 1,797 participants in the United States and India. This approach produces a high-resolution characterization of how oral transmission shapes melody, revealing the emergence of structures that are consistent with widespread musical features observed cross-culturally (small pitch sets, small pitch intervals, and arch-shaped melodic contours). We show how the emergence of these structures is constrained by individual biases in our participants\textemdash vocal constraints, working memory, and cultural exposure\textemdash which determine the size, shape, and complexity of evolving melodies. However, their ultimate effect on population-level structures depends on social dynamics taking place during cultural transmission. When participants recursively imitate their own productions (individual transmission), musical structures evolve slowly and heterogeneously, reflecting idiosyncratic musical biases. When participants instead imitate others' productions (social transmission), melodies rapidly shift toward homogeneous structures, reflecting shared structural biases that may underpin cross-cultural variation. These results provide the first quantitative characterization of the rich collection of biases that oral transmission imposes on music evolution, giving us a new understanding of how human song structures emerge via cultural transmission.},

  abstract = {In human societies, cultural norms arise when behaviours are transmitted through social networks via high-fidelity social learning. However, a paucity of experimental studies has meant that there is no comparable understanding of the process by which socially transmitted behaviours might spread and persist in animal populations. Here we show experimental evidence of the establishment of foraging traditions in a wild bird population. We introduced alternative novel foraging techniques into replicated wild sub-populations of great tits (Parus major) and used automated tracking to map the diffusion, establishment and long-term persistence of the seeded innovations. Furthermore, we used social network analysis to examine the social factors that influenced diffusion dynamics. From only two trained birds in each sub-population, the information spread rapidly through social network ties, to reach an average of 75\% of individuals, with a total of 414 knowledgeable individuals performing 57,909 solutions over all replicates. The sub-populations were heavily biased towards using the technique that was originally introduced, resulting in established local traditions that were stable over two generations, despite a high population turnover. Finally, we demonstrate a strong effect of social conformity, with individuals disproportionately adopting the most frequent local variant when first acquiring an innovation, and continuing to favour social information over personal information. Cultural conformity is thought to be a key factor in the evolution of complex culture in humans. In providing the first experimental demonstration of conformity in a wild non-primate, and of cultural norms in foraging techniques in any wild animal, our results suggest a much broader taxonomic occurrence of such an apparently complex cultural behaviour.},

However despite long-running debate, it remains an open question whether a reliance on social learning can also lead to mismatched or maladaptive behavior. In a previous study, we experimentally induced traditions for opening a bidirectional door puzzle box in replicate subpopulations of the great tit Parus major. Individuals were conformist social learners, resulting in stable cultural behaviors. Here, we vary the rewards gained by these techniques to ask to what extent established behaviors are flexible to changing conditions. When subpopulations with established foraging traditions for one technique were subjected to a reduced foraging payoff, 49\% of birds switched their behavior to a higher-payoff foraging technique after only 14 days, with younger individuals showing a faster rate of change. We elucidated the decision-making process for each individual, using a mechanistic learning model to demonstrate that, perhaps surprisingly, this population-level change was achieved without significant asocial exploration and without any evidence for payoff-biased copying. Rather, by combining conformist social learning with payoff-sensitive individual reinforcement (updating of experience), individuals and populations could both acquire adaptive behavior and track environmental change.},

An increasing body of research has not only evidenced the occurrence of cultural behaviour in nonhuman animals, but also hypothesized that such cultures could `evolve' over time in a way that shares key characteristics with biological evolution, including through a process of selection on variance, inheritance and adaptation. Outside of humans, song and contact calls in birds provide by far the most comprehensive evidence for culture and cultural evolution. However, birds have often been considered `one-trick cultural ponies' only exhibiting significant diversity in this single component of their behavioural repertoire. Recent studies have begun to challenge this view. Here, I review the evidence across multiple behavioural domains for wild cultures in birds. I then discuss the evidence in birds for four key concepts of cultural evolution: (1) variation, selection, inheritance, (2) adaptation, (3) geographical and demographic processes and (4) the accumulation of modifications. I incorporate the evidence from birdsong with other behavioural domains for each key concept and identify important gaps in knowledge. Finally, I discuss how taking a cultural evolution perspective can be informative for our understanding of cognitive ecology more broadly.},

  abstract = {Signals in animal communication are commonly judged as aesthetically appealing by human standards. This is particularly common for birdsong, often equated to musical compositions. No formal test, however, has analysed the harmonic properties of bird vocalizations. Musical intervals are based on the same physical characteristics of sound that underlie animal vocal signals. Thus, animals may use these intervals as rules to organize their vocalizations in a similar way as music. I tested a prediction derived from this hypothesis, that frequency ratios of adjacent notes in birdsong are closer to harmonic intervals than expected by chance. I determined to what degree the intervals created by adjacent notes of the song of nightingale wrens, Microcerculus philomela, conform to harmonic intervals. I analysed songs from 81 birds across the entire distribution range of the species, comparing the intervals formed by adjacent notes to three musical scales: chromatic, major diatonic and major pentatonic. Comparisons were made based on null model distributions. From 243 comparisons, only six (\$\textbackslash sim\$2\%) were significantly close to harmonic intervals, suggesting no consistent use of harmonic intervals. The frequency of the notes is the most varying song parameter in this species. If the frequencies are not determined by harmonic intervals in this species, it seems less likely that it happens in other birds with more complex song elements. Documented musical properties in birds might be caused by cultural biases of the listener or misunderstanding of the physics of musical compositions. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

  abstract = {Animal acoustic communication is one of the most fruitful research areas in behavioural and evolutionary biology. Work in this area depends largely on quantifying the structure of acoustic signals, which has often depended upon closed-source or graphical user interface (GUI)-based software. Here, we describe the r package warbleR, a new package for the analysis of animal acoustic signal structure. The package offers functions for downloading avian vocalizations from the open-access online repository Xeno-Canto, displaying the geographic extent of the recordings, manipulating sound files, detecting acoustic signals or importing detected signals from other software, assessing performance of methods that measure acoustic similarity, conducting cross-correlations, measuring acoustic parameters and analysing interactive vocal signals, among others. Functions working iteratively allow parallelization to improve computational efficiency. We present a case study showing how warbleR functions can be used in a workflow to evaluate the structure of acoustic signals. We analyse geographic variation in long-billed hermit hummingbirds (Phaethornis longirostris) songs obtained from Xeno-Canto. The code in warbleR can be executed by less experienced r users, but has also been thoroughly commented, which will facilitate further customization by advanced users. The combination of the tools described here with other acoustic analysis packages in r should significantly expand the range of analytical approaches available.},

  abstract = {Animal acoustic communication is one of the most fruitful research areas in behavioural and evolutionary biology. Work in this area depends largely on quantifying the structure of acoustic signals, which has often depended upon closed-source or graphical user interface (GUI)-based software. Here, we describe the r package warbleR, a new package for the analysis of animal acoustic signal structure. The package offers functions for downloading avian vocalizations from the open-access online repository Xeno-Canto, displaying the geographic extent of the recordings, manipulating sound files, detecting acoustic signals or importing detected signals from other software, assessing performance of methods that measure acoustic similarity, conducting cross-correlations, measuring acoustic parameters and analysing interactive vocal signals, among others. Functions working iteratively allow parallelization to improve computational efficiency. We present a case study showing how warbleR functions can be used in a workflow to evaluate the structure of acoustic signals. We analyse geographic variation in long-billed hermit hummingbirds (Phaethornis longirostris) songs obtained from Xeno-Canto. The code in warbleR can be executed by less experienced r users, but has also been thoroughly commented, which will facilitate further customization by advanced users. The combination of the tools described here with other acoustic analysis packages in r should significantly expand the range of analytical approaches available.},

The motor theory for the origin of vocal learning posits that neural centres specialized for vocal learning arose from adjacent areas in the brain devoted to general motor learning. One prediction of this hypothesis is that visual displays that rely on complex motor patterns may also be learned in taxa with vocal learning. While learning of both spoken and gestural languages is well documented in humans, the occurrence of learned visual displays has rarely been examined in non-human animals. We tested for geographical variation consistent with learning of visual displays in long-billed hermits (Phaethornis longirostris), a lek-mating hummingbird that, like humans, has both learned vocalizations and elaborate visual displays. We found lek-level signatures in both vocal parameters and visual display features, including display element proportions, sequence syntax and fine-scale parameters of elements. This variation was not associated with genetic differentiation between leks. In the absence of genetic differences, geographical variation in vocal signals at small scales is most parsimoniously attributed to learning, suggesting a significant role of social learning in visual display ontogeny. The co-occurrence of learning in vocal and visual displays would be consistent with a parallel evolution of these two signal modalities in this species.},

  abstract = {Animal cultures have now been demonstrated experimentally in diverse taxa from flies to great apes. However, experiments commonly use tasks with unrestricted access to equal pay-offs and innovations seeded by demonstrators who are trained to exhibit strong preferences. Such conditions may not reflect those typically found in nature. For example, the learned preferences of natural innovators may be weaker, while competition for depleting resources can favour switching between strategies and generalizing from past experience. Here we show that in experiments where wild jackdaws (Corvus monedula) can freely discover depleting supplies of novel foods, generalization has a powerful effect on learning, allowing individuals to exploit multiple new opportunities through both social and individual learning. Further, in contrast to studies with trained demonstrators, individuals that were first to innovate showed weak preferences. As a consequence, many individuals ate all available novel foods, displaying no strong preference and no group-level culture emerged. Individuals followed a `learn from adults' strategy, but other demographic factors played a minimal role in shaping social transmission. These results demonstrate the importance of generalization in allowing animals to exploit new opportunities and highlight how natural competitive dynamics may impede the formation of culture.},

This study provides an empirical comparison of the most widely used approach based on node-dating priors for relaxed clocks implemented in the programs BEAST and MrBayes, with two recently proposed improvements: one using a new fossilized birth-death process model for node dating (implemented in the program DPPDiv), and the other using a total-evidence or tip-dating method (imple-mented in MrBayes and BEAST). These methods are applied herein to tetraodontiform fishes, a diverse group of living and extinct taxa that features one of the most extensive fossil records among teleosts. Previous estimates of time-calibrated phylogenies of tetraodontiforms using node-dating methods reported disparate estimates for their age of origin, ranging from the late Jurassic to the early Paleocene (ca. 150-59 Ma). We analyzed a comprehensive dataset with 16 loci and 210 morphological characters, including 131 taxa (95 extant and 36 fossil species) representing all families of fossil and extant tetraodontiforms, under different molecular clock calibration approaches. Results from node-dating methods produced consistently younger ages than the tip-dating approaches. The older ages inferred by tip dating imply an unlikely early-late Jurassic (ca. 185-119 Ma) origin for this order and the existence of extended ghost lineages in their fossil record. Node-based methods, by contrast, produce time estimates that are more consistent with the stratigraphic record, suggesting a late Cretaceous (ca. 86-96 Ma) origin. We show that the precision of clade age estimates using tip dating increases with the number of fossils analyzed and with the proximity of fossil taxa to the node under assessment. This study suggests that current implementations of tip dating may overestimate ages of divergence in calibrated phylogenies.

  abstract = {Advocates of traditional, agriculture-based models of sociopolitical evolu-tion argue that the adoption of domesticates is requisite for developments such as sedentism, village life, ascribed status, hereditary leadership, and other features that underpin institutionalized political complexity. We counter in this essay with a well-documented suite of politically complex hunter-gatherer (CHG) societies that exhibit these same features, thereby demonstrating that reliance on agriculture per se\textemdash or any other specific food regime such as fishing\textemdash should be excised from explanations of emergent political complexity. Despite the failure of the agricentric model to account for a significant number of cases of institutionalized complexity, some of its architects remain entrenched in their disbelief and rigidly ignore the implications of CHG studies.

We counter in this essay with a well-documented suite of politically complex hunter-gatherer (CHG) societies that exhibit these same features, thereby demonstrating that reliance on agriculture per se\textemdash{} or any other specific food regime such as fishing\textemdash{} should be excised from explanations of emergent political complexity. Despite the failure of the agricentric model to account for a significant number of cases of institutionalized complexity, some of its architects remain entrenched in their disbelief and rigidly ignore the implications of CHG studies.

  abstract = {Statistics matter greatly in biology, whether we like it or not. As a discipline with an empirical inclination, we are faced with data every day and we rely on inferen-tial statistical models to make sense of it and to provide us with novel insights. Much of the time, the growing level of complexity and sophistication of the models we put to use in ecology and evolution have led to more appropriate analyses of our data. However, this is not always the case. Here, I draw attention to a classic flaw in inferential statistics that has resurfaced in a new flavor as a result of increased reliance on complex linear mixed models-the multifaceted and disturbingly persistent problem of pseudoreplication. The Problem of Pseudoreplication When Hurlbert [1] alerted us to the problem of pseudoreplication (see Glossary) in ecology back in 1984, it was rampant and often obvious. He found that pseudoreplication occurred in about half of all published studies that used inferential statistics to analyze field experiments. While statistical errors due to pseudoreplication may possibly have decreased somewhat in frequency among studies of that particular sort [2], this appears not to be the case in other domains of biology where pseudoreplication is still very common and where its frequency is comparable to that documented by Hurlbert back in 1984 (e.g., [3-9]). Pseudoreplication (Box 1) can be defined as testing for effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered [1] or, more generally, relating effects to inappropriate error variances. It reflects the wider issues of determining what constitutes the appropriate level or scale of independent replication for a given effect and occurs when we fail to account for dependencies across observations that are assumed by our models to be independent. It often arises as a result of a nested or hierarchical data structure and/or spatial or temporal dependencies of data. Modeling hierarchical data by complex linear mixed models (LMMs) can be a remedy for inferen-tial errors due to pseudoreplication (e.g., [10-13]). However, importantly, this will only ever be true if appropriate models are fitted to data (e.g., [6,13-15]). If random effects structures are not modeled correctly, then LMMs offer no antidote. In fact, the now widespread use of such models seems to instead have aggravated the general problem of pseudoreplication in biology (Box 1). The Issues at Hand It may seem paradoxical that more sophisticated statistical modeling should be associated with more problematic analyses. This concern stems from at least five circumstances. First, fitting models with a correct random effect structure is often very difficult [6,13-15] and the inner workings of complex LMMs are more or less obscure to many of us that put them to use [10]. For example, many of us believe that simply including one or more main random effect terms will miraculously account for dependencies in data and yield appropriate assessments of all fixed effects and interaction terms. This is typically not the case in LMMs [6,15] (Box 1). Highlights Statistical errors due to pseudoreplication are still very common in primary studies. The use of linear mixed models to analyze data can ideally resolve such problems , but only if models are structured correctly. The use of linear mixed models can instead generate such problems, if models are not appropriately structured. Inappropriate use of linear mixed models is very common in ecology and evolution, and we need to strive toward a more informed use of such models when analyzing our data.},

One possible explanation for this observation is that differences in social factors influence linguistic complexity: languages that are used for communication in small-scale 'societies of intimates' exhibit greater complexity as a result of the communicative contexts in which they are typically employed.

In Experiment 1, we explored the effects of a manipulation of group size, comparing the conventions which develop from the interaction of two speakers, with those which develop between three speakers. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the extent to which groups of three speakers share talk-relevant contextual information.

In Experiment 3, we investigated the transparency of the conventions of Experiments 1 and 2 by assessing how well they could be matched to their intended referents by naive individuals. We found no evidence to support the claims that communicative contexts involving communicating with more individuals, or individuals with whom less relevant information is shared, produce more transparent conventions. Our experiments ultimately provide no support for the idea that the structure of linguistic conventions is shaped by the groups in which they develop.},

Design Retrospective chart analysis. Setting Endocrine outpatient clinic of a psychiatric research institute. Patient(s) A total of 475 subjects (302 male-to-female transsexuals [MtF], 173 female-to-male transsexuals [FtM]). Data from 323 (192 MtF/131 FtM) were collected for hormonal and pubertal abnormalities. Information regarding chromosomal analysis was available for 270 patients (165 MtF/105 FtM). Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Pubertal abnormalities, menstrual cycle, and hormonal irregularities in relation to chromosomal analysis conducted by karyotype or hair root analysis. Result(s) In the MtF group, 5.2\% of the patients reported pubertal irregularities and 5.7\% hormonal abnormalities, and in the FtM group 3.8\% and 19.1\%, respectively. Overall chromosomal abnormality in both groups was 1.5\% (2.9\% in the FtM and 0.6\% in the MtF group). The aneuploidies found included one gonosomal aneuploidy (45,X[10]/47,XXX[6]/46,XX[98]), two Robertsonian translocations (45,XXder(14;22)(q10;q10)), and one Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) that had already been diagnosed in puberty. Conclusion(s) Our data show a low incidence of chromosomal abnormalities and thus question routine chromosomal analysis at the baseline evaluation of transsexualism, and suggest that it be considered only in cases of abnormal history or hormonal examination.

Data from 323 (192 MtF/131 FtM) were collected for hormonal and pubertal abnormalities. Information regarding chromosomal analysis was available for 270 patients (165 MtF/105 FtM). Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Pubertal abnormalities, menstrual cycle, and hormonal irregularities in relation to chromosomal analysis conducted by karyotype or hair root analysis. Result(s) In the MtF group, 5.2\% of the patients reported pubertal irregularities and 5.7\% hormonal abnormalities, and in the FtM group 3.8\% and 19.1\%, respectively. Overall chromosomal abnormality in both groups was 1.5\% (2.9\% in the FtM and 0.6\% in the MtF group). The aneuploidies found included one gonosomal aneuploidy (45,X[10]/47,XXX[6]/46,XX[98]), two Robertsonian translocations (45,XXder(14;22)(q10;q10)), and one Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) that had already been diagnosed in puberty. Conclusion(s) Our data show a low incidence of chromosomal abnormalities and thus question routine chromosomal analysis at the baseline evaluation of transsexualism, and suggest that it be considered only in cases of abnormal history or hormonal examination.

Observers were shown two sequentially presented orientations and required to reproduce each orientation after a delay. The sequential presentation minimized perceptual interactions so that we could isolate interactions between memory representations per se. We found that similar orientations were repelled from each other whereas dissimilar orientations were attracted to each other. In addition, when one of the items was given greater attentional priority by means of a cue, the representation of the high-priority item was not influenced very much by the orientation of the low-priority item, but the representation of the low-priority item was strongly influenced by the orientation of the high-priority item. This indicates that attention modulates the interactions between working memory representations. In addition, errors in the reported orientations of the two objects were positively correlated under some conditions, suggesting that representations of distinct objects may become grouped together in memory. Together, these results demonstrate that working-memory representations are not independent but instead interact with each other in a manner that depends on attentional priority.},

  abstract = {Biologists and philosophers of science have recently called for an extension of evolutionary theory. This so-called 'extended evolutionary synthesis' (EES) seeks to integrate developmental processes, extra-genetic forms of inheritance, and niche construction into evolutionary theory in a central way. While there is often agreement in evolutionary biology over the existence of these phenomena, their explanatory relevance is questioned. Advocates of EES posit that their perspective offers better explanations than those provided by 'standard evolutionary theory' (SET). Still, why this would be the case is unclear. Usually, such claims assume that EES's superior explanatory status arises from the pluralist structure of EES, its different problem agenda, and a growing body of evidence for the evolutionary relevance of developmental phenomena (including developmental bias, inclusive inheritance, and niche construction). However, what is usually neglected in this debate is a discussion of what the explanatory standards of EES actually are, and how they differ from prevailing standards in SET. In other words, what is considered to be a good explanation in EES versus SET? To answer this question, we present a theoretical framework that evaluates the explanatory power of different evolutionary explanations of the same phenomena. This account is able to identify criteria for why and when evolutionary explanations of EES are better than those of SET. Such evaluations will enable evolutionary biology to find potential grounds for theoretical integration.}

Previous work had discovered a correlation between the repertoire size of males and their lifetime reproductive success. In our experiment, females were brought into reproductive behavior by photoperiod and hormone manipulations and tested in the laboratory. Tests involved repertoire sizes ranging from one to five song types, spanning most of the variation found in natural populations of singing males. The number of copulationsolicitation displays given by the females increased with repertoire size. Our results are consistent with the "truth in advertising" model of sexual selection for the evolution of large repertoire size in songbirds. Females obtain a direct reproductive advantage from mating with males with large repertoires.},

Inter-copulatory orgasms will therefore lower the pH of the cervical mucus and either kill or reduce the mobility of any sperm that attempt to penetrate from reservoirs in the cervical crypts. Intercopulatory orgasms may also serve an antibiotic function. Copulatory and inter-copulatory orgasms endow females with considerable flexibility in their manipulation of inseminates. The data suggest that, in purely monandrous situations, females reduced the number of sperm retained, perhaps as a strategy to enhance conception.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}In male songbirds, song functions to attract a mate or to defend a territory; it is therefore often produced in the context of reproduction. Testosterone of gonadal origin increases during the reproductive phase of the annual cycle and significantly enhances song production as well as song development via effects on song crystallization. The neural control of birdsong production and learning is highly modular. We implanted testosterone or androgen antagonists into specific brain regions or in the periphery of castrated male canaries and in this way identified how androgen signaling in specific locations regulates a variety of birdsong features. For example, castrated male canaries treated with testosterone in the preoptic area only and exposed to long days sing at high rates compared to castrated male canaries not treated with testosterone. However, these birds with testosterone in the preoptic area still produce songs with substantially lower song stereotypy and amplitude; these features are controlled by testosterone acting in the song control nuclei HVC and RA. Specific aspects of the learned singing behavior are thus regulated by androgens acting at multiple levels in the brain in a non-redundant fashion. Testosterone action in the preoptic area is related to the hormonal regulation of the motivation to sing but not to various aspects of song performance. Multiple aspects of song quality are instead precisely regulated by steroids acting in distinct song control nuclei. Females exert a strong choice for specific features of male song in canaries and this choice is influenced by the endocrine state of the female. The female song system is also involved in song production as well as song perception but the specificity of this hormone action has not been investigated yet.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Microsatellite markers are routinely used to investigate the genetic structuring of natural populations. The knowledge of how genetic variation is partitioned among populations may have important implications not only in evolutionary biology and ecology, but also in conservation biology. Hence, reliable estimates of population differentiation are crucial to understand the connectivity among populations and represent important tools to develop conservation strategies. The estimation of differentiation is c from Wright's FST and/or Slatkin's RST, an FST -analogue assuming a stepwise mutation model. Both these statistics have their drawbacks.

Potential for equifinality exists in all empirical studies of cultural transmission including controlled experiments, observational field research, and computational simulations. Acknowledging and anticipating the existence of equifinality is important in empirical studies of social learning and cultural evolution; it helps us understand the limitations of analytical approaches and can improve our ability to predict the dynamics of cultural transmission. Here, I illustrate and discuss examples of equifinality in studies of social learning, and how certain experimental designs might be prone to it. I then review examples of equifinality discussed in the social learning literature, namely the use of s-shaped diffusion curves to discern individual from social learning and operational definitions and analytical approaches used in studies of conformist transmission. While equifinality exists to some extent in all studies of social learning, I make suggestions for how to address instances of it, with an emphasis on using data simulation and methodological verification alongside modern statistical approaches that emphasize prediction and model comparison. In cases where evaluated learning mechanisms are equifinal due to non-methodological factors, I suggest that this is not always a problem if it helps us predict cultural change. In some cases, equifinal learning mechanisms might offer insight into how both individual learning, social learning strategies and other endogenous social factors might by important in structuring cultural dynamics and within- and between-group heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Cultural diversity and stability of a population affect the adaptiveness and survival of individuals. Besides field studies, cultural diversity and stability have been investigated with the help of different modeling approaches in relatively simple cultures. These theoretical studies helped identify mechanisms that generate cultural diversity through increasing the proportion of new elements in the population, for example by immigration or erroneous learning. Copy-the-majority learning strategies, forms of positive frequency-dependent learning, have a rather opposite effect: while they help in maintaining cultural stability by favoring the spread of common elements, they also decrease cultural diversity. We investigated whether these basic, conflicting mechanisms are sufficient together to create a complex, polymorphic cultural system and to maintain its diversity and stability. For that we developed an individual-based model simulating song learning in birds in which the extent of immigration, the frequency of learning mistakes and the strength of positive frequency-dependent learning were included as modifiable parameters. From the model, we obtained information on the composition and temporal changes in the individual and population repertoires. A comparison with long-term field data on a European passerine bird species with moderate song complexity, the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis), was also performed. Our results confirmed that certain combinations of the three investigated mechanisms were indeed able to create patterns that showed certain aspects of polymorphic cultures. Yet, several discrepancies occurred when comparing the simulation results with the field data that emphasize the implementation of other mechanisms, especially those that have a stabilizing effect. Long-term metastable states, found in the population-level cultural diversity, raise awareness to animal cultures' possible sensitivity to external factors.},

It addresses the question of why song sparrows learn the songs they do, given that they are exposed to many more songs than they will keep for their final repertoire of 7\textendash{} 11 song types. A young song sparrow moves from his natal area at about 1 month of age, eventually settling in an area where he learns the songs of the resident males and attempts to establish his own territory. Birds that share many songs with their neighbours in their first breeding season (the spring following their hatch summer) survive for more years on territory than birds that do not. Many features of the song-learning process lead to a high level of sharing with first-year neighbours, including preferentially learning the songs of their tutor-neighbours who survive the winter, and learning songs that are shared by several tutors. Social interaction appears to be critical in song learning, but indirect effects (eavesdropping on adults countersinging) seem to be at least as important as direct interaction between the young bird and his tutor-neighbours. Although our evidence suggests that the song-learning strategy of young song sparrows is beneficial to them, a preliminary analysis suggests it may not benefit their tutors.},

Nevertheless, little is known about how or why birds choose the songs they do learn from the many they will hear under natural conditions. We focus on various theories concerning social song learning that have been offered to date, with special attention paid to two axes of social factors. First, does song learning occur via direct interaction of the young bird with song tutors, or via social eavesdropping by the young bird on interacting singers (social modeling of song)? Social modeling, a hypothesis first proposed by Pepperberg (Zeitschrift f\"ur Tierpsychologie, 55(2), 139-160, 1981), and direct interaction are not mutually exclusive hypotheses, and the evidence we review suggests both play a role in song learning. Second, does song learning occur via interactions with rivals (territorial competitors) or with friends (mutually tolerant or even cooperative territorial neighbors). These are largely mutually exclusive hypotheses, and can really only be tested in the field. There is little evidence on this contrast to date. We review our recent study on song sparrows, which indicates that both the young bird and his primary tutor may benefit from song learning/tutoring. If this mutual benefit result is confirmed by further studies, we believe that song ``tutoring'' in these cases may be more than a term of convenience: that it may qualify as true teaching.},

In the present study we contrast two mutually exclusive hypotheses about the tutor/tutee relationship: (1) that it is cooperative, or at least mutually tolerant, with tutor and tutee mutually benefiting from their relationship, versus (2) that it is competitive, with tutor and tutee competing over territory, so that one or the other suffers negative fitness consequences of their relationship. In a field study of three consecutive cohorts of song sparrows, Melospiza melodia morphna, we determined the older bird (primary tutor) from whom the young bird (tutee) learned most of his songs, and how long tutee and primary tutor survived subsequently. We found that the more songs a tutee learns from his primary tutor, the longer their mutual survival on their respective territories. While the number of songs they share predicts the mutual survival of tutor and tutee, it does not predict the independent survival of tutor or tutee, suggesting that the benefit each receives from song sharing exists only so long as both survive.},

  abstract = {The divergence of sexual signals is ultimately a coevolutionary process: while signals and preferences diverge between lineages, they must remain coordinated within lineages for matings to occur. Divergence in sexual signals makes a major contribution to evolving species barriers. Therefore, the genetic architecture underlying signal\textendash preference coevolution is essential to understanding speciation but remains largely unknown. In \emph{Laupala} crickets where male song pulse rate and female pulse rate preferences have coevolved repeatedly and rapidly, we tested two contrasting hypotheses for the genetic architecture underlying signal\textendash preference coevolution: linkage disequilibrium between unlinked loci and genetic coupling (linkage disequilibrium resulting from pleiotropy of a shared locus or tight physical linkage). Through selective introgression and quantitative trait locus (QTL) fine mapping, we estimated the location of QTL underlying interspecific variation in both female preference and male pulse rate from the same mapping populations. Remarkably, map estimates of the pulse rate and preference loci are as close as 0.06 cM apart, the strongest evidence to date for genetic coupling between signal and preference loci. As the second pair of colocalizing signal and preference loci in the \emph{Laupala} genome, our finding supports an intriguing pattern, pointing to a major role for genetic coupling in the quantitative evolution of a reproductive barrier and rapid speciation in \emph{Laupala}. Owing to its effect on suppressing recombination, a coupled, quantitative genetic architecture offers a powerful and parsimonious genetic mechanism for signal\textendash preference coevolution and the establishment of positive genetic covariance on which the Fisherian runaway process of sexual selection relies.}

  abstract = {Vocalisations of many songbirds, anurans, and insects are shaped by sexual selection. Males acoustically compete for territories, and females choose their mates by means of male courtship songs. In courtship, richness and complexity of elements are often favoured characters. Only a few examples of complex songs are known in mammals. Males of the harem-polygynous sac-winged bat (Saccopteryx bilineata, Emballonuridae) have an uncommonly complex vocal repertoire, and different song types of males are used in the context of territorial defence and in courting females. We classified the daytime vocalisations of 16 male S. bilineata from a colony in Costa Rica, both on the basis of their acoustical properties and the social context in which they occurred. Seven vocalisation types were differentiated: echolocation pulses, barks, chatter, whistles, screeches, territorial songs and courtship songs. Territorial songs were short, rather stereotyped and not obviously directed towards a certain conspecific. They appear to be of importance in male competition for harem territories, in which females roost during the day. Courtship songs were exclusively observed when males displayed towards a female; they were long and complex, and consisted of highly variable elements (``calls''). We classified the calls in courtship songs of six males into call types, based on acoustical properties, mainly spectral purity and duration. Four call types are described in detail: trills, noise-bursts, ``short tonal'' calls, and ``quasi constant frequency'' calls. Twelve parameter values were extracted from the most common call type, the trill. Discriminant function analysis of trills showed that different males had different repertoires. This could allow females to use trill parameters for recognition of individual males and thus for mate choice.},

Specifically, we show that (i) short-term changes in state influence contributions to a cooperative behaviour, (ii) individuals communicate short-term changes in state, and (iii) individuals use information about the state of group mates to adjust their own investment in sentinel behaviour. Our results demonstrate that individual decisions about contributions to a cooperative effort can be influenced by information about the likely future contribution of others. We suggest that similar pre-emptive adjustments based on information obtained from collaborators will be a common feature of cooperative behaviour, and may play an important role in the development of complex communication in social species.},

We further explore how both social and collective learning during group navigation could lead to the accumulation of knowledge at the population level, resulting in the emergence of migratory culture.},

Since the 1970s, the (re)turn to ethnography has been considered short of a paradigmatic change, and it has indeed stirred a lot of theoretical discussion in the very under-theorized field of rock art research. The ethnographic turn has been mainly built around shamanism, very loosely defined here as the causal association that researchers establish between shamanic practices and rock art, and from which explanations have been sought. The application of this approach has changed through time, depending on 1) the archaeological context in which it was to be applied, 2) the use of additional sources of evi- dence (namely, neuropsychology), 3) the role of shamanism as a hypothesis or as an established fact. As a hypothesis it has been built on the basis of three dif- ferent kinds of analogies: ethnographic, formal and uniformitarian. This paper addresses the shifting character of shamanism in South African and European Palaeolithic rock art studies, seeking to contribute at least in part to a broader reflection on the nature of analogical reasoning and its implications.},

  abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Are markers of chronic inflammation associated with menstrual symptom severity and premenstrual syndrome (PMS)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Serum levels of inflammatory markers, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-gamma were positively associated with menstrual symptom severity and/or PMS in young women. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Chronic inflammation has been implicated in the etiology of depression and other disorders that share common features with PMS, but whether inflammation contributes to menstrual symptom severity and PMS is unknown. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cross-sectional study of 277 women aged 18-30 years, conducted in 2006-2011. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants provided information on menstrual symptoms, lifestyle, diet, anthropometry and other factors by questionnaire and/or direct measurement, and a mid-luteal phase fasting blood sample was taken between 7 a.m. and 12 p.m. Total, physical and affective menstrual symptom scores were calculated for all participants, of whom 13\% (n = 37) met criteria for moderate-to-severe PMS and 24\% (n = 67) met PMS control criteria. Inflammatory factors assayed in serum included IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, IFN-gamma and C-reactive protein. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: After adjustment for age, smoking status and BMI, total menstrual symptom score was positively associated with levels of IL-2 (percentage difference in women at the 75th percentile of total symptom score versus at the 25th percentile = 24.7\%; P = 0.04), IL-4 (21.5\%; P = 0.04), IL-10 (28.0\%; P {$<$} 0.01) and IL-12 (42.0\%; P = 0.02) in analyses including all participants. Affective menstrual symptom score was linearly related to levels of IL-2 (percentage difference at 75th percentile versus 25th percentile = 31.0\%; P = 0.02), while physical/behavioral symptom score was linearly related to levels of IL-4 (19.1\%; P = 0.03) and IL-12 (33.2\%; P = 0.03). Additionally, mean levels of several factors were significantly higher in women meeting PMS criteria compared with women meeting control criteria, including IL-4 (92\% higher in cases versus controls; P = 0.01); IL-10 (87\%; P = 0.03); IL-12 (170\%; P = 0.04) and IFN-gamma (158\%; P = 0.01). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our study has several limitations. While a single blood sample may not perfectly capture long-term levels of inflammation, ample data suggest that levels of cytokines are stable over time. Although we did not base our assessment of PMS on prospective symptom diaries, we used validated criteria to define PMS cases and controls, and excluded women with evidence of comorbid mood disorders. Furthermore, because of the cross-sectional design of the study, the temporal relation of inflammatory factors and menstrual symptoms is unclear. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: To our knowledge, this is among the first studies to suggest that inflammatory factors may be elevated in women experiencing menstrual symptoms and PMS. Additional studies are needed to determine whether inflammation plays an etiologic role in PMS.

Several morphometric traits have been argued to be under selection by climatic factors, but it is unclear whether climate affects the global decline in morphological diversity with increasing geographical distance from sub-Saharan Africa. Using a large database of male and female skull measurements, we apply an explicit framework to quantify the relative role of climate and distance from Africa. We show that distance from sub-Saharan Africa is the sole determinant of human within-population phenotypic diversity, while climate plays no role. By selecting the most informative set of traits, it was possible to explain over half of the worldwide variation in phenotypic diversity. These results mirror those previously obtained for genetic markers and show that 'bones and molecules' are in perfect agreement for humans.},

It is highly debated to what extent this variability has accumulated through neutral processes (genetic drift) or through natural selection driven by climate. By taking advantage of recent work showing that geographic distance along landmasses is an excellent proxy for neutral genetic differentiation, we quantify the relative role of drift versus selection in an exceptionally large dataset of human skulls. We show that neutral processes have been much more important than climate in shaping the human cranium. We further demonstrate that a large proportion of the signal for natural selection comes from populations from extremely cold regions. More generally, we show that, if drift is not explicitly accounted for, the effect of natural selection can be greatly overestimated.},

  abstract = {One of the main events in the history of our species has been our expansion out of Africa. A clear signature of this expansion has been found on global patterns of neutral genetic variation, whereby a serial founder effect accompanied the colonization of new regions, in turn creating a wilhin-pupulation decrease in neutral genetic diversity with increasing distance from Africa. This same distinctive pattern has also been described for cranial and dental morphological variation in human populations distributed across the globe. Here, we used a data set of postcranial linear measurements for 30 globally distributed human populations, and a climatic data set of minimum annual temperature, maximum annual temperature, and precipitation in order to separate for the first time the relative effect of neutral demographic processes and climatic selection on four long (limb) bones (femur, tibia, radius, and humerus) versus the pelvic bones of the human appendicular skeleton. We implemented a stepwise regression procedure in which phenotypic variance is assumed to be affected by the iterative founder events that accompanied human expansion from Africa, as well as by climate. This model included, as independent factors, geographic distance from central Africa, the three climatic variables, and all possible interactions between the three climatic variables. We excluded all nonsignificant factors by backward stepwise elimination with the aim of identifying the minimal model significantly explaining variation in the phenotypic data. Our results indicate a sharp difference in the way the pelvis and the limb bones reflect the neutral signature of the out-of-Africa expansion. Consistent with previous analyses of the cranium and dentition, pelvic shape variation shows a significant within-population decrease with increasing distance from Africa. However, no such pattern could be found in the long bones. Rather, in the case of both the tibia and the femur, a significant relationship between population-level variance and minimum temperature was demonstrated. Hence, in the case of these limb bones, it is probable that the effects of climatic selection have obliterated the demographic signature of human dispersal from Africa. Our finding mat pelvic variation exhibits the neutral effects of demographic history suggests that consideration of this skeletal element might be used to shed light on factors of human population history, just as the cranium has done.},

We analysed the frequency of use of signals of differ-ent duration in the vocal repertoires of two Neotropical primate species studied in the wild\textemdash the common marmoset (Callithrix jac-chus) and the golden-backed uakari (Cacajao melanocephalus). The key prediction of the law of brevity was not supported in either species: although the most frequently emitted calls were relatively brief, they were not the shortest signals in the repertoire. The costs and benefits associ-ated with signals of different duration must be appreciated to understand properly their fre-quency of use. Although relatively brief vocal signals may be favoured by natural selection in order to minimize energetic costs, the very brief-est signals may be ambiguous, contain reduced information or be difficult to detect or locate, and may therefore be selected against. Analogies between human language and vocal communi-cation in animals can be misleading as a basis for understanding frequency of use, because coding efficiency is not the only factor of impor-tance in animal communication, and the costs and benefits associated with different signal durations will vary in a species-specific manner.},

Surprisingly, the question of why sexual reproduction generally requires the combination of distinct gamete classes, such as small and large gametes, or gametes with different mating types, has been much less investigated. Why do systems with alternative gamete classes (i.e. systems with either anisogamy or mating types or both) appear even though they restrict the probability of finding a compatible mating partner? Why does the number of gamete classes vary from zero to thousands, with most often only two classes? We review here the hypotheses proposed to explain the origin, maintenance, number, and loss of gamete classes. We argue that fungi represent highly suitable models to help resolve issues related to the evolution of distinct gamete classes, because the number of mating types vary from zero to thousands across taxa, anisogamy is present or not, and because there are frequent transitions between these conditions. We review the nature and number of gamete classes in fungi, and we attempt to draw inferences from these data on the evolutionary forces responsible for their appearance, loss or maintenance, and number.},

In each discipline, cultural evolutionists investigate how interactions between individuals translate into group level patterns, with the aim of explaining the diachronic dynamics and diversity of cultural traits. However, while much attention has been given to deterministic processes (e.g. cultural transmission biases), we contend that current evolutionary accounts of cultural change are limited because they do not adopt a systematic stochastic approach (i.e. accounting for the role of chance). First, we show that, in contrast with the intense debates in ecology and population genetics, the importance of stochasticity in evolutionary processes has generated little discussion in the sciences of cultural evolution to date. Second, we speculate on the reasons, both ideological and methodological, why that should be so. Third, we highlight the inadequacy of genetically-inspired stochastic models in the context of cultural evolution modelling, and ask which fundamental stochastic processes might be more relevant to take up. We conclude that the field of cultural evolution would benefit from a stochastic revolution. For that to occur, stochastic models ought to be developed specifically for cultural data and not through a copy-pasting of neutral models from population genetics or ecology.},

Male songbirds often engage in singing contests where they vary the type and timing of signals and provide eavesdropping individuals with information about their competitiveness. How this information is used and its effect on subsequent spatial behaviour and reproductive decisions of eavesdroppers is not well understood. Here we tested whether great tits use information gathered by eavesdropping on male singing interactions to assess rivals and (potential) mates. We used interactive playback experiments to engage territorial males in song contests with either a more (song overlapping and more persistent singing) or less challenging (song alternating and less persistent singing) intruder. We followed male and female movements by automated radiotracking, determined paternity using microsatellite analysis and maternal investment by quantifying egg weights and provisioning behaviour. We expected that mates of males exposed to the challenging treatment would subsequently foray more often off territory to assess other males and potential extrapair mates and invest less in their broods. Moreover, we expected that neighbours would adjust their foraying behaviour according to information gained by eavesdropping. Females, however, did not alter their foraying behaviour or brood investment and neither female nor male neighbours changed their visiting behaviour to playback territories. Our results provide no evidence that females used information gathered by eavesdropping on asymmetric song interactions in reproductive decisions or that song interactions affected movements across territories in the neighbourhood. Overlapping or singing for a longer time on an intruded upon territory may not always be perceived as a higher level of threat, and reproductive decisions and assessment of familiar individuals are likely to be based on multiple sources of information rather than on a single interaction.},

The supranational conservation objectives brought on by Finland's membership in the European Union (EU) and the regional application of the official policy on wolves have led to conflicts. This article is based on the preparation process of the wolf management plan in Finland. As a part of the process, a nationwide hearing was arranged in 2004. Fear of wolves is widespread and even more common in areas with low wolf population. People living in areas where wolves occur feel that they can no longer influence decision making which affects them and that the authorities, conservationists, and the EU do not listen to their opinions. Numerous requests have been made for the legislation and its interpretation, and concessions to these requests would promote consensus and increase tolerance for wolves. Proposed changes include reforming the damage compensation system and formulating a clearer interpretation of the conservation status of wolves. However, it seems impossible to create a policy that would be universally supported. As the wolf question has become more central in environmental policy, the conservation and management of the species have become more complicated, and the cooperation between various interest groups has declined. The wolf conflict could be mitigated by compromises, but because the conflict is value-based, solutions are illusive.},

  abstract = {Songbirds living in temperate forests experience great seasonal changes in habitat acoustics during the part of the breeding season when singing activity is high. These changes, which are brought about by accelerated vegetation growth and leaf burst in spring, affect sound propagation and potentially render vocal communication more difficult as the total number of scattering and absorbing obstacles increases. We investigated this in a sound transmission experiment in which representative great tit (Parus major) songs were broadcast in a typical forest habitat before and after foliation. Speaker and microphone were placed at natural separation distances and in typical sender and receiver positions. For each song note we quantified several aspects of sound degradation and found that they all increased considerably when leaves were present. Before foliation the same amount of degradation would only be obtained by doubling the transmission distance, i.e. foliage shortens the active space of great tit song. This inevitably alters distance information, provided that distance-dependent, structural changes of received songs are used as ranging cues. Moreover, sender and receiver positions within the canopy become unfavourable compared to heights just below the canopy when the aim is to maximise song propagation distances. Altogether, the presence of foliage greatly affects the potential for vocal information transfer in great tits and requires behavioural and/or perceptual adjustment of the communicating individuals to counteract or reduce the impact of foliage on signal degradation.}

Pair bond maintenance and coordination of the pair's reproductive efforts are important, and the female's ability to recognize her mate's song should therefore be adaptive. In a neighbour-mate discrimination playback experiment, we presented 13 incubating great tit females situated inside nestboxes with a song of their mate and the same song type from a neighbour. Each female was tested in two trials with the opposite order of stimulus presentation. Eleven females responded to the song of their mate in both trials, while two females responded to those of their mate in one trial and a neighbour in the other. Thus, great tit females are able to perceive subtle individual differences between their mate's song and a neighbour's rendition of the same song type despite being inside nestboxes, which are known to alter the received song structure and intensity. We suggest that this female discrimination ability inside nest holes is mediated by a high perceptual sensitivity towards small variations in song structure that should be adaptive to this hole-nesting bird species. \textcopyright{} 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

It has been shown that subgroups of informed individuals can steer the remainder of the group without direct communication, resolving conflicts of interest through individual-to-individual interactions. We present a model for the navigation of collectively moving groups that includes preferential interactions between individuals as a way of imposing social network structures, known to be present in many species. We show that effective leadership can occur when leaders do not occupy frontal spatial positions and when navigation tendency is appropriately balanced with social position. Our model also shows that small minorities can dominate movement decisions if they have navigational knowledge combined with influential social network positions. Our findings highlight the mechanistic importance of social networks for the movement decisions of animal groups. We discuss the implications of our research for interpreting empirical observations.},

We suggest that a precise comparison of the hunting behavior of a species closely related to man might help us understand which aspects of hunting could be affected by environmental conditions. The hunting behavior of wild chimpanzees is discussed, and new observations on a population living in the tropical rain forest of the Ta\"i National Park, Ivory Coast, are presented. Some of the forest chimpanzees' hunting performances are similar to those of savanna-woodlands populations; others are different. Forest chimpanzees have a more specialized prey image, intentionally search for more adult prey, and hunt in larger groups and with a more elaborate cooperative level than savanna-woodlands chimpanzees. In addition, forest chimpanzees tend to share meat more actively and more frequently. These findings are related to some theories on aspects of hunting behavior in early hominids and discussed in order to understand some factors influencing the hunting behavior of wild chimpanzees. Finally, the hunting behavior of primates is compared with that of social carnivores.},

Various statistical methods exist for estimating network changes through time. One approach, time-aggregated networks, takes repeated snapshots of interactions within windows of time to generate a time series of networks. However, there remain many analytical hurdles when implementing the time-aggregated approach. To ameliorate this, we introduce an R package netTS that focuses on three analytical steps for analyzing time-aggregated networks: choosing appropriate time scale using bootstrapping, comparing patterns to relevant null models using permutation, and finally building and interpreting statistical models using simulated data. We use simulated data to first highlight these steps, then use observed grooming data from a group of vervet monkeys as an applied example.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}3.Our results suggest that the use of bootstrapping and permutation can accurately extract known patterns from simulated data.

  abstract = {Branching processes are used to model diverse social and physical scenarios, from extinction of family names to nuclear fission. However, for a better description of natural phenomena, such as viral epidemics in cellular tissues, animal populations and social networks, a spatial embedding---the branching random walk (BRW)---is required. Despite its wide range of applications, the properties of the volume explored by the BRW so far remained elusive, with exact results limited to one dimension. Here we present analytical results, supported by numerical simulations, on the scaling of the volume explored by a BRW in the critical regime, the onset of epidemics, in general environments. Our results characterise the spreading dynamics on regular lattices and general graphs, such as fractals, random trees and scale-free networks, revealing the direct relation between the graphs' dimensionality and the rate of propagation of the viral process. Furthermore, we use the BRW to determine the spectral properties of real social and metabolic networks, where we observe that a lack of information of the network structure can lead to differences in the observed behaviour of the spreading process. Our results provide observables of broad interest for the characterisation of real world lattices, tissues, and networks.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess symptom ratings on the first day of menses to identify women at high risk of clinically significant premenstrual syndrome (PMS) who should undergo further evaluation. METHODS: A cohort of 697 women kept daily symptom ratings using the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP). The DRSP includes 21 symptom items grouped within 11 domains. DRSP scores on the first day of menses were calculated using the sum of all 21 items (standard method), the sum of the highest rated items within each domain (alternative method), and the sum of seven items derived from modeling. Seventy percent of the study sample was randomly assigned into a model-building set to identify optimal cutoff scores for PMS screening. The remaining 30\% comprised a testing set used to compare PMS screening results to a PMS diagnosis based on two cycles of daily DRSP ratings. RESULTS: Of the initial study sample, 388 participants (55.7\%) completed two cycles of daily ratings. The prevalence of PMS was 30.4\%. In the model-building set, the positive and negative predictive values of the 21-item DRSP scores were 53.8\% and 83.4\% using the standard method and 52.7\% and 84.0\% using the alternative method. Corresponding values were 55.0\% and 84.9\% for an abbreviated seven-item DRSP version. These results were confirmed in the testing set. CONCLUSION: The DRSP administered on the first day of menses is an acceptable screening instrument to identify women who may have PMS.},

Experiment 1 employed a learning task in which all children were asked at different times to discriminate vertically symmetrical, obliquely symmetrical, and horizontally symmetrical holistic patterns from asymmetrical ones. The results revealed a developmental progression: 4-year-olds discriminated only vertical, 5-year-olds, vertical and horizontal, and 6-year-olds, vertical, horizontal, and oblique. Experiment 2 retested the 6-year-olds with fragmented patterns of the different symmetries; these children regressed to the performance level of 4-year-olds and only discriminated vertical. Experiment 3 used a memory-reproduction task with new vertical, oblique, horizontal, and asymmetrical patterns constructed of four, five, or six elements. Measures of the goodness and accuracy of children's reproductions were consistent with data from the discrimination-learning experiments in terms of age. stimulus orientation, and stimulus complexity. These studies support the view that vertical symmetry is special perceptually and developmentally and that, after vertical, horizontal predominates, followed by oblique. The role of symmetry in early perceptual development and the value of child-adult perceptual comparisons are discussed.},

Similarly, function words (e.g. pronouns) have shorter duration than content words (e.g. nouns). In compounds, forms annotated as reduced display shorter duration. Fingerspelling duration correlates with word length of corresponding Swedish words, and frequency and word length play a role in the lexicalization of fingerspellings. The sign distribution in the SSL Corpus shows a great deal of cross-linguistic similarity with other sign languages in terms of which signs appear as high-frequency items, and which categories of signs are distributed across text types (e.g. conversation vs. narrative). We find a correlation between an increase in age and longer mean sign duration, but see no significant difference in sign duration between genders.}

The quantitative study of gene-culture coevolution has focused in particular on the mechanisms responsible for change in frequency and attributes of cultural traits, the spread of cultural information through demic and cultural diffusion, and detecting relationships between genetic and cultural lineages. Here, we make use of worldwide whole-genome sequences [Pagani et al. (2016) Nature 538:238-242] to assess the impact of processes involving population movement and replacement on cultural diversity, focusing on the variability observed in folktale traditions (n\,=\,596) [Uther (2004) The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography. Based on the System of Antti Aarne and Stith Thompson] in Eurasia. We find that a model of cultural diffusion predicted by isolation-by-distance alone is not sufficient to explain the observed patterns, especially at small spatial scales (up to [Formula: see text]4,000 km). We also provide an empirical approach to infer presence and impact of ethnolinguistic barriers preventing the unbiased transmission of both genetic and cultural information. After correcting for the effect of ethnolinguistic boundaries, we show that, of the alternative models that we propose, the one entailing cultural diffusion biased by linguistic differences is the most plausible. Additionally, we identify 15 tales that are more likely to be predominantly transmitted through population movement and replacement and locate putative focal areas for a set of tales that are spread worldwide.},

Incubation in birds is energetically costly and the balance between parental and offspring's energetic needs is especially challenging when only one sex incubates, generally the female. In that case, males can contribute indirectly to incubation effort by feeding their mate and females may use begging behaviours to signal their needs to their visiting partner. The great tit, Parus major, is a good model species to test whether females use acoustic communication from the nest to signal their needs to their mate outside because females interact vocally with their mate during incubation. To test whether females use these vocal exchanges to communicate how hungry they are, great tit pairs were recorded on 2 days during incubation: 1 day with a feeder of mealworms in the nestbox and 1 day with an empty feeder. First, food supplementation increased females' nest attentiveness, revealing a decrease in foraging activity and consequently in females' needs. Second, females signalled their need for food both during their male's visits inside the nest but also during the vocal exchange immediately preceding the male's entrance by calling more and by modifying the frequency spectrum of their calls. So females' calling behaviour is an honest signal of need not only during their male's visits, but also before his entrance in the nest.},

However, it is rather sensitive to borrowing events, coding errors, semantic shift and other anomalies, so other models, in particular the covarion model, tends to have a better fit to the data. Here, we introduce the pseudo Dollo model, a model of character evolution along a tree that can be formulated as a three-state continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) model. The initial state represent absence of a feature, then a birth event allows the feature to be present. A death event can follow so that the feature becomes absent again. However, no new birth events are allowed after a death event has taken place. We examine the model in a fully Bayesian setting, and demonstrate it can have a better fit than some of the popular alternative models on some real world datasets. Some variations on the pseudo Dollo model are introduced as well, including the multi-state pseudo Dollo model and pseudo Dollo covarion model. The model is implemented in open source software Babel, a package to BEAST licensed under LGPL.

Recent studies indicate that the differences between these modes parallel differences between the prosodic and spectral characteristics of voiced speech sounds uttered in corresponding emotional states. Here we ask whether tonality and emotion are similarly linked in an Eastern musical tradition. The results show that the tonal relationships used to express positive/excited and negative/subdued emotions in classical South Indian music are much the same as those used in Western music. Moreover, tonal variations in the prosody of English and Tamil speech uttered in different emotional states are parallel to the tonal trends in music. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the association between musical tonality and emotion is based on universal vocal characteristics of different affective states.},

Years that are poor for survival of young affect individuals laying larger clutches much more than they affect those laying smaller clutches. This 'bad-years effect' reduces the mean and increase the variance in fitness for individuals laying large clutches more than it does for individuals laying smaller clutches. hence it is more advantageous, in the long term, for birds to lay clutches smaller than the most productive clutch size. -from Authors}

A Darwinian theory ultimately should be capable of answering two closely related questions about the evolutionary properties of cultural transmission. First, the theory should predict the effect of different structures of cultural transmission on the evolutionary process. . . . Second, the theory should allow us to understand the conditions under which different structures of cultural transmission might evolve.  To amend neo-Darwinian theory so that it addresses these questions we proceed in two steps. First, we construct simple mathematical models of cultural transmission in which the assumed structures of cultural transmission are based as much as possible on the results of empirical research done by psychologists and anthropologists. . . . Second, we link these models of cultural transmission to models of genetic evolution and attempt to determine the circumstances under which natural selection might favor the modes of cultural transmission observed among contemporary humans.

It is, however, constrained by evolved properties of the mind. Recurrent- not necessarily universal fea- tures of acquired culture can be explained by taking into account the early development and constraining power of intuitive ontology, a set of principled domain-specific inferential capacities. These allow us to predict recurrent trends in domains as diverse as folk-psychology, representations of natural kinds, the uses of literacy, the acquisition of scientific beliefs, and even the limiting-case of religious ontologies. In all these domains the notion of cultural transmission along domain- specific cognitive tracks governed by intuitive ontology is supported by independent psychological evidence and provides testable explanations for recurrent features in the anthropological record.},

No evidence for perceptual balancing was observed in drawings produced on pages with lateral figures, nor was any evidence for closure apparent with complex figures. The present results agree with earlier findings that chimpanzees will engage in drawing activities without training or reinforcement, and this behavior may reflect their intrinsic interest in exploratory and manipulative play.},

Conservation practice has long been guided by genetic, ecological and demographic indicators of risk. Emerging evidence of animal culture across diverse taxa and its role as a driver of evolutionary diversification, population structure and demographic processes may be essential for augmenting these conventional conservation approaches and decision-making. Animal culture was the focus of a ground-breaking resolution under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), an international treaty operating under the UN Environment Programme. Here, we synthesize existing evidence to demonstrate how social learning and animal culture interact with processes important to conservation management. Specifically, we explore how social learning might influence population viability and be an important resource in response to anthropogenic change, and provide examples of how it can result in phenotypically distinct units with different, socially learnt behavioural strategies. While identifying culture and social learning can be challenging, indirect identification and parsimonious inferences may be informative. Finally, we identify relevant methodologies and provide a framework for viewing behavioural data through a cultural lens which might provide new insights for conservation management.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p class="Para"{$>$}Heterogeneous environments can create differential selection pressures among populations, which may result in the evolution of local adaptations. Premating isolation mechanisms may emerge due to limited movement among locally adapted individuals, thus further enhancing such adaptations. The song of male songbirds is one potential premating isolation mechanism that has long been of interest because of its implications for mate choice, local adaptation, and speciation associated with environmental heterogeneity. We tested whether locally adapted mountain chickadees exhibit variation in song structure along an elevation gradient and whether song structure shifts with the distinct change in winter climate severity around the snowline. These birds exhibit large elevation-related differences in numerous behavioral and neurological traits, including variation in spatial cognition associated with fitness consequences. We recorded song along two continuous elevation gradients and detected significant differences among the sampling sites along an elevation gradient and between "high" and "low" elevation songs. Our current results, coupled with previously reported winter climate-related differences are generally consistent with the local adaptation hypothesis explaining geographic variation in song, which suggests that variation in song structure could serve as an indicator of local adaptation. Our study shows that song differences can evolve on a small spatial scale along a continuous species distribution when there is a rapid change in environmental conditions also favoring the evolution of local adaptations.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}h3 class="Heading"{$>$}Significance statement{$<$}/h3{$><$}p class="Para"{$>$}Local adaptations may evolve when heterogeneous environments result in differential selection on fitness-related traits. If locally adapted populations experience reduced movement, additional traits may also change over time and serve as indicators of origin. The ability to identify and mate with local males, which are likely adapted to the prevailing environment, should procure a fitness advantage such that offspring produced with a local individual will inherit the genetic material that made that individual successful. Temperate male bird song is initially learned near the nest, varies geographically, and is commonly used by females to assess male quality. Using mountain chickadees that inhabit an elevation gradient associated with large phenotypic differences, we found significant variation in song structure along an elevation gradient and that male song also changes significantly at an important ecological threshold, consistent with high- and low-elevation songs that may be used by females to identify and mate with local males.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

The social structures of these systems can be studied in depth by means of network analysis. A large number of studies on animal social networks in many species have in recent years been carried out within the biological research field of animal behaviour and have provided new insights into behaviour, ecology, and social evolution. This line of research is currently not well connected to the field of complex systems. Here we provide an introduction to animal social networks for complex systems scientists. We believe that an increased integration of animal social networks with the interdisciplinary field of complex systems \&amp; networks would be beneficial for various reasons. Increased collaboration between researchers in this field and biologists studying animal social systems could be valuable in solving challenges of particular importance to animal social network research. Furthermore, high-resolution datasets of social networks from different animal species can be useful for investigating general hypotheses about complex systems. In this paper, we describe what animal social networks are and how they are scientifically important; we give an overview of the methods commonly used to study animal social networks; and finally we highlight challenges in the study of animal social networks where input from researchers with expertise in complex systems could be particularly valuable. We hope that this will help to facilitate further interdisciplinary collaborations involving animal social networks, and lead to better integration of these networks into the field of complex systems.}

  abstract = {Exaggerated sex swellings characterized by increased size of skin surrounding the anogenital region occur in female chimpanzees in response to ovarian hormone fluctuations and are associated with increased likelihood of ovulation and female receptivity. The swellings generate heightened sexual interest from males and evoke increased male competitive behavior. To determine potential attractiveness of specific visual characteristics of these signals to males, a free choice task using push-button methodology that allowed subjects to choose one stimulus in a pair by pressing a button corresponding to the stimulus choice was developed. Initially, preferences for specific food items were first determined based on animals' selection of actual items, followed by selection of same items from photographs and subsequently selection of preferred food utilizing push-button responses to photographs. We found that when allowed to choose between photographs of sex swellings, novel objects, and other body parts, male chimpanzees preferred images of both sex swellings and other body parts over images of objects, and showed a significant preference for sex swellings over other body parts. However, chimpanzees showed no preference in sex swelling color or symmetry. Only one subject displayed a preference for normal sized swellings rather than enlarged swellings. Overall these results suggest that when considered individually, visual characteristics alone are not sufficient to provoke preference responding. Sex},

In line with these critiques, this paper examines culturally diverse patients' views about the symptoms, aetiology, and experiences of their depression, and considers how socio-structural forces are implicated in the illness experience. Analysing the transcripts of interviews with 28 Indian-Australians and 30 Anglo-Australians with depression, our results reveal cultural differences between Indian- and Anglo-Australians regarding the chronicity, perceived severity, and aetiology of their depression. Our results also show how these cultural differences are related to socio-structural forces such as time, money, and migration. We conclude by arguing that the current medicalised approach to treating depression needs to shift to a more empathetic problem-solving one; such a change would prompt greater critica...},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Major depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, yet epidemiologic data are not available for many countries, particularly low- to middle-income countries. In this paper, we present data on the prevalence, impairment and demographic correlates of depression from 18 high and low- to middle-income countries in the World Mental Health Survey Initiative. METHODS Major depressive episodes (MDE) as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DMS-IV) were evaluated in face-to-face interviews using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Data from 18 countries were analyzed in this report (n = 89,037). All countries surveyed representative, population-based samples of adults. RESULTS The average lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates of DSM-IV MDE were 14.6\% and 5.5\% in the ten high-income and 11.1\% and 5.9\% in the eight low- to middle-income countries. The average age of onset ascertained retrospectively was 25.7 in the high-income and 24.0 in low- to middle-income countries. Functional impairment was associated with recency of MDE. The female: male ratio was about 2:1. In high-income countries, younger age was associated with higher 12-month prevalence; by contrast, in several low- to middle-income countries, older age was associated with greater likelihood of MDE. The strongest demographic correlate in high-income countries was being separated from a partner, and in low- to middle-income countries, was being divorced or widowed. CONCLUSIONS MDE is a significant public-health concern across all regions of the world and is strongly linked to social conditions. Future research is needed to investigate the combination of demographic risk factors that are most strongly associated with MDE in the specific countries included in the WMH.},

  abstract = {SignificanceEvolutionary methods are increasingly being applied to investigating linguistic change. But does language change conform to the predictions of evolutionary theory? Here, we use data from closely related pairs of languages to show that a key prediction of evolutionary theory is met: rates of gain of new words are higher in larger populations whereas rates of word loss are greater in small populations. Our analysis provides, to our knowledge, the first statistically robust evidence of an influence of population size on rate of language change. These results demonstrate the potential for demographic factors to influence language evolution. The effect of population size on patterns and rates of language evolution is controversial. Do languages with larger speaker populations change faster due to a greater capacity for innovation, or do smaller populations change faster due to more efficient diffusion of innovations? Do smaller populations suffer greater loss of language elements through founder effects or drift, or do languages with more speakers lose features due to a process of simplification? Revealing the influence of population size on the tempo and mode of language evolution not only will clarify underlying mechanisms of language change but also has practical implications for the way that language data are used to reconstruct the history of human cultures. Here, we provide, to our knowledge, the first empirical, statistically robust test of the influence of population size on rates of language evolution, controlling for the evolutionary history of the populations and formally comparing the fit of different models of language evolution. We compare rates of gain and loss of cognate words for basic vocabulary in Polynesian languages, an ideal test case with a well-defined history. We demonstrate that larger populations have higher rates of gain of new words whereas smaller populations have higher rates of word loss. These results show that demographic factors can influence rates of language evolution and that rates of gain and loss are affected differently. These findings are strikingly consistent with general predictions of evolutionary models.},

The primary care clinic is also a site for enactment of a disease-oriented concept of depression that locates disorder within an individual body. Drawing on theories of the self and stigma, this article highlights problematics of primary care depression treatment by examining the lived experience of depression. The data come from individuals who screened positive for depressive symptoms in primary care settings and were followed over ten years. After iterative mixed-methodological exploration of a large dataset, we analyzed interviews from a purposive sample of 46 individuals using grounded and phenomenological approaches. We describe two major results. First, we note that depression is experienced as located within and inextricable from relational space and that the self is experienced as relational, rather than autonomous, in depression. Second, we describe the ways in which the experience of depression contradicts a disease-oriented concept such that help-seeking intensifies rather than alleviates the relational problem of depression. We conclude by highlighting that an understanding of illness experience may be essential to improving primary care depression treatment and by questioning the bracketing of relational concerns in depression within the construct of stigma.},

  abstract = {Climate models provide the principal means of projecting global warming over the remainder of the twenty-first century but modelled estimates of warming vary by a factor of approximately two even under the same radiative forcing scenarios. Across-model relationships between currently observable attributes of the climate system and the simulated magnitude of future warming have the potential to inform projections. Here we show that robust across-model relationships exist between the global spatial patterns of several fundamental attributes of Earth's top-of-atmosphere energy budget and the magnitude of projected global warming. When we constrain the model projections with observations, we obtain greater means and narrower ranges of future global warming across the major radiative forcing scenarios, in general. In particular, we find that the observationally informed warming projection for the end of the twenty-first century for the steepest radiative forcing scenario is about 15 per cent warmer (+0.5 degrees Celsius) with a reduction of about a third in the two-standard-deviation spread (-1.2 degrees Celsius) relative to the raw model projections reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Our results suggest that achieving any given global temperature stabilization target will require steeper greenhouse gas emissions reductions than previously calculated.}

Working- class women wer much more likely to develop depression because they experienced more of these factors. A new survey in a rural population in the Outer Hebrides has confirmed the importance of these factors in the genesis of depression, although provoking agents occurred much less frequently in this rural setting. However, integration into the traditional way of life, rather than a middle-class status, was related to a lower chance of developing depression, and this appears to be explained by the relationship of provoking agents and vulnerability factors to such integration in the Outer Hebrides, and to social class status in Camberwell.},

These simplifications can allow us to focus on differences that are meaningful, while ignoring those that are not. However, simplification also requires assumptions, and to the extent that these are wrong, so is our ability to predict or compare. Here, we discuss approaches for evaluating the performance of evolutionary models in light of their assumptions by comparing them against reality. We highlight general approaches, how they are applied, and remaining opportunities.

This behaviour may help to maintain a given transmission distance of songs, which are used in territory defence and mate attraction. At the same time, birds forced to sing with higher amplitudes have to bear the increased costs of singing. 4 This suggests that in songbirds the level of environmental noise in a territory will contribute to its quality and thus considerably affect the behavioural ecology of singing males.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies over the past decade have reported correlations between elevated levels of anthropogenic noise and a rise in the minimum frequency of acoustic signals of animals living in noisy habitats. This pattern appears to be occurring globally, and higher pitched signals have been hypothesized to be adaptive changes that reduce masking by low-frequency traffic noise. However, the sound analysis methods most often used in these studies are prone to measurement errors that can result in false positives. In addition, the commonly used method of measuring frequencies visually from spectrograms might also lead to observer-expectancy biases that could exacerbate measurement errors. We conducted an experiment to (i) quantify the size and type of errors that result from `eye-balling' frequency measurements with cursors placed manually on spectrograms of signals recorded in noise and no-noise conditions, and (ii) to test whether observer expectations lead to significant errors in frequency measurements. We asked 54 volunteers, blind to the true intention of our study, to visually measure the minimum frequency of a variety of natural and synthesized bird sounds, recorded either in noise, or no-noise conditions. Test subjects were either informed or uninformed about the hypothesized results of the measurements. Our results demonstrate that inappropriate methodology in acoustic analysis can yield false positives with effect sizes as large, or even larger, than those reported in published studies. In addition to these measurement artefacts, psychological observer biases also led to false positives \textendash{} when observers expected signals to have higher minimum frequencies in noise, they measured significantly higher minimum frequencies than uninformed observers, who had not been primed with any expectation. The use of improper analysis methods in bioacoustics can lead to the publication of spurious results. We discuss alternative methods that yield unbiased frequency measures and we caution that it is imperative for researchers to familiarize themselves both with the functions and limitations of their sound analysis programmes. In addition, observer-expectancy biases are a potential source of error not only in the field of bioacoustics, but in any situation where measurements can be influenced by human subjectivity.},

  abstract = {Noise pollution has been linked to learning and language deficits in children, but the causal mechanisms connecting noise to cognitive deficiencies remain unclear because experimental models are lacking. Here, we investigated the effects of noise on birdsong learning, the primary animal model for vocal learning and speech development in humans. We found that traffic noise exposure retarded vocal development and led to learning inaccuracies. In addition, noise suppressed immune function during the sensitive learning period, indicating that it is a potent stressor for birds, which is likely to compromise their cognitive functions. Our results provide important insights into the consequences of noise pollution and pave the way for future studies using birdsong as an experimental model for the investigation of noise-induced learning impairments.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the field of psychology has begun to conduct replication tests on a large scale. Here, we show that "replicator degrees of freedom" make it far too easy to obtain and publish false-negative replication results, even while appearing to adhere to strict methodological standards. Specifically, using data from an ongoing debate, we show that commonly exercised flexibility at the experimental design and data analysis stages of replication testing can make it appear that a finding was not replicated when, in fact, it was. The debate that we focus on is representative, on key dimensions, of a large number of other replication tests in psychology that have been published in recent years, suggesting that the lessons of this analysis may be far reaching. The problems with current practice in replication science that we uncover here are particularly worrisome because they are not adequately addressed by the field's standard remedies, including preregistration. Implications for how the field could develop more effective methodological standards for replication are discussed.}

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007755},
  abstract = {Analyzing the rhythm of animals' acoustic signals is of interest to a growing number of researchers: evolutionary biologists want to disentangle how these structures evolved and what patterns can be found, and ecologists and conservation biologists aim to discriminate cryptic species on the basis of parameters of acoustic signals such as temporal structures. Temporal structures are also relevant for research on vocal production learning, a part of which is for the animal to learn a temporal structure. These structures, in other words, these rhythms, are the topic of this paper. How can they be investigated in a meaningful, comparable and universal way? Several approaches exist. Here we used five methods to compare their suitability and interpretability for different questions and datasets and test how they support the reproducibility of results and bypass biases. Three very different datasets with regards to recording situation, length and context were analyzed: two social vocalizations of Neotropical bats (multisyllabic, medium long isolation calls of {$<$}em{$>$}Saccopteryx bilineata{$<$}/em{$>$}, and monosyllabic, very short isolation calls of {$<$}em{$>$}Carollia perspicillata){$<$}/em{$>$} and click trains of sperm whales, {$<$}em{$>$}Physeter macrocephalus{$<$}/em{$>$}. Techniques to be compared included Fourier analysis with a newly developed goodness-of-fit value, a generate-and-test approach where data was overlaid with varying artificial beats, and the analysis of inter-onset-intervals and calculations of a normalized Pairwise Variability Index (nPVI). We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the methods and we also show suggestions on how to best visualize rhythm analysis results. Furthermore, we developed a decision tree that will enable researchers to select a suitable and comparable method on the basis of their data. In the analysis of animal communication more and more interest is shown in rhythm of animal communication and what information this might convey. In this paper, we establish a workflow to analyze the temporal structure\textendash namely the rhythm\textendash of any particular animals'acoustic signal with methods that are applicable for a wide range of signals and results that are easily comparable and interpretable. This workflow will enhance the understanding of rhythmicality in animals' acoustic signals as well as facilitate comparison between species. Methods we conducted ranged from simple distributional and visual analysis to higher mathematics such as Fourier analysis. All analyses rely on Inter-Onset-Intervals, the duration between the beginning of one element and the next. We used different datasets from two neotropical bat species as well as from the sperm whale. With this selection, we cover very short sequences with only few elements up to sequences of around 200 elements, multisyllabic and monosyllabic sequences and social communication as well as sounds used for orientation and foraging.}

To assess the outcome of this process in a population of chestnut-sided warblers (Dendroica pensylvanica), we recorded songs at intervals over a 19-year period. These recordings revealed the pattern of cultural evolution of songs in our study area, from which we inferred likely learning predispositions and mechanisms of cultural transmission. We found that the species' two song categories form two distinct cultural traditions, each with its own pattern of change over time. Unaccented-ending songs have undergone continual, rapid turnover of song and element types, consistent with a model of neutral cultural evolution. Accented-ending songs, in contrast, persisted virtually unchanged for the entire study period, with extraordinarily constant song form and only one appearance of a new song type. Our results indicate that in songbirds, multiple independent cultural traditions and probably multiple independent learning predispositions can evolve concurrently, especially when different signal classes have become specialized for different communicative functions. \textcopyright{} 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

Even in social species, it is unclear how migratory skills are transmitted from one generation to another and what implications this may have. Here we show that in Caspian terns Hydroprogne caspia family groups, genetic and foster male parents carry the main responsibility for migrating with young. During migration, young birds stayed close to an adult at all times, with the bond dissipating on the~wintering grounds. Solo-migrating adults migrated faster than did adults accompanying young. Four young that lost contact with their parent at an early stage of migration all died. During their first solo migration, subadult terns remained faithful to routes they took with their parents as young. Our results provide evidence for cultural inheritance of migration knowledge in a long-distance bird migrant and show that sex-biased (allo)parental care en route shapes migration through social learning., Animals often migrate in social groups, but little is known about the social learning of migration behaviours. Here, Byholm et al. analyse high-resolution tracking data from Caspian Terns and reveal that juveniles' survival and learning of migration routes depend critically on following a parent.},

Aims and objectives: We therefore aimed to review the place of routine chromosome analysis in the management of GD in children and adolescents. Patients and methods: 490 children and adolescents with GD have been referred to the two endocrine clinics forming part of the joint National Gender Identity Development Service since 2009. Chromosome analysis and physical examination are performed routinely to exclude a DSD. Results: One de novo sex chromosome variation (47,XYY) was identified. The prenatal diagnosis of 47,XXX was confirmed in one other (total sex chromosome aneuploidy rate 1:245). Neither would have been suspected phenotypically nor did the finding have any bearing on the management of the GD. In addition, karyotyping revealed two individuals with balanced familial translocations and one with a small marker chromosome, none of which had any clinical consequences (total autosomal aneuploidy rate 1:163). The finding of these karyotype variations is within known population aneuploidy prevalence rates (1:250 sex chromosomes; 1:150 autosomes). Conclusions: No additional chromosome variations were identified in children and adolescents with GD over and above the frequency expected within the general population. This differs from the situation in a DSD. Chromosome analysis in children and adolescents with GD may not, therefore, be routinely indicated.},

Kin selection predicts that caste determination should result from environmentally induced differences in gene expression, a prediction largely supported by empirical data. However, two exceptional cases of genetically determined caste differentiation have recently been found in harvester ants. Here we show that genetic caste determination evolved in these populations after complex hybridization events. We identified four distinct genetic lineages, each consisting of unique blends of the genomes of the parental species, presumably Pogonomyrmex barbatus and P. rugosus. Crosses between lineages H1 and H2 and between J1 and J2 give rise to workers, whereas queens develop from within-lineage matings. Although historical gene flow is evident, genetic exchange among lineages and between lineages and the parental species no longer occurs. This unusual system of caste determination seems to be evolutionarily stable.},

Up to 90\% of women of childbearing age report perceiving one or more symptoms during the days before menstruation, symptoms which can alter their behaviour and wellbeing and which, therefore, can affect their family, social and work circle. However, and notwithstanding this general prevalence, the clinical entity that in a large number of cases results from these symptoms, commonly known as the premenstrual syndrome, still lacks defined and validated contents so that recommendations of treatments backed by adequate experimental and clinical evidence are only slowly appearing. In the present paper, we review recent experimental data as to a possible aetiology of the premenstrual problem. We propose a Premenstrual Profile, i.e. a new register of symptoms, to be used for the differential diagnosis of the three forms of the premenstrual alteration. Finally, we review the evidence-based recommendations from reliable sources as regards the treatment of "normal" and "abnormal" premenstrual symptoms. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Defined as group-specific behaviour transmitted by social learning, culture is shaped by social structure. However, culture can itself affect social structure if individuals preferentially interact with others whose behaviour is similar, or cultural symbols are used to mark groups. Using network form- alism, this interplay can be depicted by the coevolution of nodes and edges together with the coevolution of network topology and transmission patterns. We review attempts to model the links between the spread, persistence and diversity of culture and the network topology of non-human societies. We illustrate these processes using cetaceans. The spread of socially learned beg- ging behaviour within a population of bottlenose dolphins followed the topology of the social network, as did the evolution of the song of the hump- back whale between breeding areas. In three bottlenose dolphin populations, individuals preferentially associated with animals using the same socially learned foraging behaviour. Homogeneous behaviour within the tight, nearly permanent social structures of the large matrilineal whales seems to result from transmission bias,with cultural symbols marking social structures. We recommend the integration of studies of culture and society in species for which social learning is an important determinant of behaviour.},

  abstract = {In humans and several other species, face and body symmetry have been found to enhance physical attractiveness. A proposed explanation is that symmetry is a phenotypic indicator of biological fitness. Throughout the world, symmetrical designs also are a common feature in face and body painting and the decorative arts. The implication is that symmetrical designs might provide an additional way to enhance physical attractiveness. To find out, we conducted three experiments, two with human faces and one with abstract or nonrepresentational designs. In Experiments 1 and 2, we showed undergraduate students photographs of pairs of faces and instructed them to choose the more attractive face in each pair. The photographs were of physically symmetrical and asymmetrical faces (as indexed by facial features) that had been decorated with either symmetrical or asymmetrical designs of the kind used in many preindustrial societies. As indexed by the number of times they were chosen, symmetrical faces were judged to be more attractive than asymmetrical faces; adding asymmetrical designs to symmetrical faces decreased their attractiveness; and adding symmetrical designs to asymmetrical faces increased their attractiveness. In Experiment 3, undergraduates made similar choices from pairs of abstract designs taken from several cultures and modified in shape, coloration, and orientation of design features. Symmetrical designs again were judged to be more attractive, with shape and coloration playing the more important roles. We interpret the results as suggesting that the same mechanisms underlying the judgment of physical attractiveness also underlie cultural practices of face painting and abstract art. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The diversity and the motor performance of birdsongs can both be sexually selected. In wood warblers, most species with high motor performance sing a greater proportion of trills, presumably to advertise performance, and thus have lower syllable diversity. We tested if this trade-off between motor performance and syllable diversity extends to canaries, goldfinches and allies, a clade with much longer and more varied songs. We assembled a molecular phylogeny and inferred song motor performance based on the speed of frequency modulation either in trills or in within-song intervals. The two metrics of performance were positively, but only mildly, related across species. While performance evaluated in intervals had high phylogenetic signal, performance evaluated in trills changed independently of phylogeny and was constrained by body size. Species in densely vegetated habitats sang fewer trills, but did not differ in motor performance. Contrary to wood warblers, song motor performance did not predict the proportion of trilled syllables nor within-song syllable diversity, perhaps because large differences in the song duration of canaries, goldfinches and allies prevent trills from severely compromising syllable diversity. Opposed results in wood warblers and in these finches indicate the existence of clade-specific trade-offs in the evolution of birdsong.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}This article is protected by copyright.

A source of contention is that cultural mutation may be substantial and, if it drives cultural change, then current evolutionary models are not adequate. But we lack studies quantifying the contribution of mutations to directional cultural change. We estimated the contribution of one type of cultural mutations-modification of memes-to directional cultural change using an amenable study system: learned birdsongs in a species that recently entered an urban habitat. Many songbirds have higher minimum song frequency in cities, to alleviate masking by low-frequency noise. We estimated that the input of meme modifications in an urban songbird population explains about half the extent of the population divergence in song frequency. This contribution of cultural mutations is large, but insufficient to explain the entire population divergence. The remaining divergence is due to selection of memes or creation of new memes. We conclude that the input of cultural mutations can be quantitatively important, unlike in genetic evolution, and that it operates together with other mechanisms of cultural evolution. For this and other traits, in which the input of cultural mutations might be important, quantitative studies of cultural mutation are necessary to calibrate realistic models of cultural evolution. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Animal alarm calls can contain detailed information about a predator's threat, and heterospecific eavesdropping on these signals creates vast communication networks. While eavesdropping is common, this indirect public information is often less reliable than direct predator observations. Red-breasted nuthatches (\emph{Sitta canadensis}) eavesdrop on chickadee mobbing calls and vary their behaviour depending on the threat encoded in those calls. Whether nuthatches propagate this indirect information in their own calls remains unknown. Here we test whether nuthatches propagate direct (high and low threat raptor vocalizations) or indirect (high and low threat chickadee mobbing calls) information about predators differently. When receiving direct information, nuthatches vary their mobbing calls to reflect the predator's threat. However, when nuthatches obtain indirect information, they produce calls with intermediate acoustic features, suggesting a more generic alarm signal. This suggests nuthatches are sensitive to the source and reliability of information and selectively propagate information in their own mobbing calls.}

However, little research has examined IVR in more socially demanding circumstances, such as when an individual discriminates all individuals in their social or familial group apart. In this review, we describe what IVR is and suggest splitting studies of IVR into two general types based on what questions they answer (IVR-singular, and IVR-multiple). We explain how we currently test for IVR, and many of the benefits and drawbacks of different methods. We address why IVR is so prevalent in the animal kingdom, and the circumstances in which it is often found. Finally, we explain current weaknesses in IVR research including temporality, specificity, and taxonomic bias, and testing paradigms, and provide some solutions to address these weaknesses.}

Second, these features are also excellent k-NN classifiers, reaching 78.3\% top-1 on ImageNet with a small ViT. Our study also underlines the importance of momentum encoder, multi-crop training, and the use of small patches with ViTs. We implement our findings into a simple self-supervised method, called DINO, which we interpret as a form of self-distillation with no labels. We show the synergy between DINO and ViTs by achieving 80.1\% top-1 on ImageNet in linear evaluation with ViT-Base.},

  abstract = {Learning of song in birds provides a powerful model for human speech development [1\textendash 3]. However, the degree to which songbirds and humans share social mechanisms of vocal learning is unknown. Although it has been demonstrated as a vocal learning mechanism in human infants [3\textendash 6], learning via active social feedback is considered rare and atypical among non-human animals [7]. We report here the first evidence that song learning in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), the most common model species of vocal learning and development, utilizes socially guided vocal learning. We demonstrate experimentally that the songs of juvenile zebra finches are guided toward mature vocal forms by real-time visual feedback from adult females that is contingent on their early, immature vocalizations. Using a video playback paradigm, we found that juvenile birds that received non-vocal female feedback contingently on their immature song learned significantly better and more accurate song than did yoked controls that received identical but non-contingent feedback. Both contingent and non-contingent groups sang at similar rates. Thus, we have provided the first evidence suggesting that non-imitative social learning is a crucial, potentially widespread mechanism of vocal development and have established a foundational parallel between humans and our most ubiquitous animal model of vocal learning: the crucial role of social feedback to immature vocalizations in the development of communication. The zebra finch is the most common model of human speech development but, unlike humans, is thought to learn only via imitation. Carouso-Peck and Goldstein show that song learning is affected by non-vocal, visual feedback from females. Young males given feedback contingent on their immature songs developed higher-quality songs than yoked controls.},

Here, we present a comprehensive X-inactivation profile of the human X chromosome, representing an estimated 95\% of assayable genes in fibroblast-based test systems. In total, about 15\% of X-linked genes escape inactivation to some degree, and the proportion of genes escaping inactivation differs dramatically between different regions of the X chromosome, reflecting the evolutionary history of the sex chromosomes. An additional 10\% of X-linked genes show variable patterns of inactivation and are expressed to different extents from some inactive X chromosomes. This suggests a remarkable and previously unsuspected degree of expression heterogeneity among females.},

  abstract = {A recent study claimed face skin color as a sexually dimorphic variable that influences attractiveness preferences in mate choice. Thereby, skin color may assume the role of a mate quality signal influencing attractiveness preferences. As body odor is linked to attractiveness, this study aimed to explore whether the odors of men with more masculine facial skin color would be evaluated more positively than odors from less masculine men. Female raters were presented with body odors of 18 men and were asked to rate them in various characteristics. Multilevel modeling revealed that the odors of the donors with more masculine color were rated not only as more attractive, more pleasant, and sexier, but also healthier. This indicates that odor associated with men with more masculine skin color is attractive, just as other sexually dimorphic traits. Furthermore, we found a negative relation between skin color masculinity and perceived odor maleness. Regarding this last finding, a new discussion is introduced with respect to the influence of cognitive stereotypes in odor judgments. Altogether, the study supports the possibility that chemosensory signals may be communicating signs of mate quality associated with masculinity.},

Investigation of 50 well-documented apparitions of the Virgin Mary between 1100-1896 and this indicates that 1) Marian apparitions are as likely to occur to males as females; 2) seers are likely to be sexually mature individuals who lack obvious sexual partners; and 3) Italy has always accounted for a disproportionate share of such seers. Following Freud, it is argued that apparitions result from the blocking of sexual impulses. These blocked sexual impulses reactivate infantile impulses long since repressed, and it is these reactivated infantile impulses that determine the content of an apparition. Marian apparitions in particular are produced by the intensification of certain aspects of the Oedipal process. Specifically, males find in the Marian apparitions an ideal way of sublimating their intense sexual desire for the mother, and females find in such apparitions a way of sublimating their sexual desire for the father. This explanation is capable of accounting for all the patterns described previously. However, relative infrequency of Marian apparitions in Spain, which has a family structure similar to that found in Italy, is an anomaly with respect to the interpretation developed here, and that anomaly is discussed. Finally, the interpretation presented here suggests that there should be systematic differences between the Marian apparitions experienced by males and those experienced by females, and those differences do appear in the data.},

The cha\^ine op\'eratoire conceptual framework, as introduced by ethnography, established technology as a phased process. Prehistoric archaeology adopted this concept to elucidate technological variability in tool-making procedures, based on knowledge of tool functions or subsistence patterns. We focused on the detection of operational sequences by wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) when nut cracking with lithic implements at the sites of Bossou and Dieck\'e, Guinea, West Africa. Thus, while it has recently been claimed that chimpanzees leave behind recognizable assemblages of stone hammers that can be morphologically distinguished from Oldowan hammers, this is the first study to focus specifically on the existence of operational sequences during the utilization of stone tools by wild chimpanzees. By combining primatological and archaeological methods and examining ecological areas inhabited by different chimpanzee groups, we sought technological variability and identified variables influencing regional diversity in tool typology and technology. We compared three case studies: (1) Bossou-direct recording of experimental nut-cracking sessions; (2) Bossou- direct and indirect monitoring of nut-cracking sites in the wild; (3) Dieck\'e-indirect monitoring of nut-cracking sites in the wild. Results suggest that chimpanzees perform sequences of repeated tool transport and nut cracking. Data show discrimination of tool functions based on tool features. We identified the most technologically complex tool for nut cracking, which was composed of four stones. We found regional diversity in chimpanzee stone assemblages. Raw-material type and tool mobility constrain technological development in human and nonhuman primates. Spatial analysis of tool distribution indicates a pattern of resource-exploitation strategy, revealing affinities with Oldowan. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Extensively updated from the first edition, the main thrust of this book is to suggest that the two main functions of song are attracting a mate and defending territory. It shows how this evolutionary pressure has led to the amazing variety and complexity we see in the songs of different species throughout the world. Writing primarily for students and researchers in animal behavior, the authors review over 1000 scientific papers and reveal how scientists are beginning to unravel and understand how and why birds communicate with the elaborate vocalizations we call song. Highly illustrated throughout and written in straightforward language, Bird Song also holds appeal for amateur ornithologists with some knowledge of biology.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest that individuals with better problem-solving and/or learning performance have greater reproductive success, and that individuals may thus benefit from choosing mates based on these performances. However, directly assessing these performances in candidate mates could be difficult. Instead, the use of indirect cues related to problem-solving and/or learning performance, such as condition-dependent phenotypic traits, might be favored. We investigated whether problem-solving and learning performance on a novel non-foraging task correlated with sexually selected plumage colouration in a natural population of great tits Parus major. We found that males successful in solving the task had darker blue-black crowns than non-solvers, and that males solving the task more rapidly over multiple attempts (i.e. learners) exhibited blue-black crowns with higher UV chroma and shorter-wavelength hues than non-learners. In contrast, we found no link between behavioural performance on the task and the yellow breast colouration in either sex. Our findings suggest that blue-black crown colouration could serve as a signal of problem-solving and learning performance in wild great tit males. Further research remains necessary to determine whether different sexually selected traits are used to signal cognitive performance for mate choice, either directly (i.e. cognitive performance influencing individual's health and ornamentation through diet for example) or indirectly (i.e. due to a correlation with a third factor such as individual quality or condition).}

  abstract = {Sensitivity to the sequential structure of communication sounds is fundamental not only for language comprehension in humans but also for song recognition in songbirds. By quantifying single-unit responses, we first assessed whether the sequential order of song elements, called syllables, in conspecific songs is encoded in a secondary auditory cortex-like region of the zebra finch brain. Based on a habituation/dishabituation paradigm, we show that, after multiple repetitions of the same conspecific song, rearranging syllable order reinstated strong responses. A large proportion of neurons showed sensitivity to song context in which syllables occurred providing support for the nonlinear processing of syllable sequences. Sensitivity to the temporal order of items within a sequence should enable learning its underlying structure, an ability considered a core mechanism of the human language faculty. We show that repetitions of songs that were ordered according to a specific grammatical structure (i.e., ABAB or AABB structures; A and B denoting song syllables) led to different responses in both anesthetized and awake birds. Once responses were decreased due to song repetitions, the transition from one structure to the other could affect the firing rates and/or the spike patterns. Our results suggest that detection was based on local differences rather than encoding of the global song structure as a whole. Our study demonstrates that a high-level auditory region provides neuronal mechanisms to help discriminate stimuli that differ in their sequential structure.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Sequence processing has been proposed as a potential precursor of language syntax. As a sequencing operation, the encoding of the temporal order of items within a sequence may help in recognition of relationships between adjacent items and in learning the underlying structure. Taking advantage of the stimulus-specific adaptation phenomenon observed in a high-level auditory region of the zebra finch brain, we addressed this question at the neuronal level. Reordering elements within conspecific songs reinstated robust responses. Neurons also detected changes in the structure of artificial songs, and this detection depended on local transitions between adjacent or nonadjacent syllables. These findings establish the songbird as a model system for deciphering the mechanisms underlying sequence processing at the single-cell level.},

Here we performed a systematic study of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of adult male mice carrying the KE family mutation. Using novel statistical tools, we found that Foxp2 heterozygous mice did not have detectable changes in USV syllable acoustic structure, but produced shorter sequences and did not shift to more complex syntax in social contexts where wildtype animals did. Heterozygous mice also displayed a shift in the position of their rudimentary laryngeal motor cortex layer-5 neurons.

The proposed class of FRActional Probit (FRAP) models is based on thresholding of a latent process consisting of an additive expansion of a smooth Gaussian process with a fractional Brownian motion. We develop a Bayesian approach to inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo, and show good performance in simulation studies. Applying the methods to the Amazon bird vocalization data, we find substantial evidence for self-similarity and non-Markovian/Poisson dynamics. To accommodate the bird vocalization data, in which there are many different species of birds exhibiting their own vocalization dynamics, a hierarchical expansion of FRAP is provided in Supplementary Materials.}

Although count models are often used for this purpose, they are not strictly appropriate for this type of data because the response variable is bounded above. Furthermore, if some peoples' substance use behaviors are characterized by various weekly patterns of use, summaries of substance days-of-use used over longer periods can exhibit multiple modes. These characteristics of substance days-of-use data are not easily fitted with conventional parametric model families. We propose a continuation ratio ordinal model for substance days-of-use data. Instead of grouping the set of possible response values into a small set of ordinal categories, each possible value is assigned its own category. This allows the exact numeric distribution implied by the predicted ordinal response to be recovered. We demonstrate the proposed model using survey data reporting days of alcohol use over 28-day intervals. We show the continuation ratio model is better able to capture the complexity in the drinking days dataset compared to binomial, hurdle-negative binomial and beta-binomial models.},

To further distinguish prior cortical competence from adaptation induced by learning to read, we manipulated whether the selected configurations formed letters and whether they were presented on the horizontal meridian, the familiar location where words usually appear, or on the vertical meridian. While no natural-scene frequency effect was observed, we observed letter-status and letter frequency effects on bilateral occipital activation, mainly for horizontal stimuli. The findings suggest a reorganization of the visual pathway resulting from reading acquisition under genetic and connectional constraints. Even early retinotopic areas showed a stronger response to letters than to rotated versions of the same shapes, suggesting an early visual tuning to large visual features such as letters.},

  abstract = {A leading idea of cultural evolutionary theory is that for human cultures to undergo evolutionary change, cultural transmission must generally serve as a high-fidelity copying process. In analogy to genetic inheritance, the high fidelity of human cultural transmission would act as a safeguard against the transformation and loss of cultural information, thus ensuring both the stability and longevity of cultural traditions. Cultural fidelity would also serve as the key difference-maker between human cumulative cultures and non-human non-cumulative traditions, explaining why only us humans, with our uniquely high-fidelity transmission capabilities, are capable of evolving and sustaining complex traditions. But what does it mean for cultural transmission to be more or less faithful? This article has two objectives. The first is to clarify the meaning and uses of the concept of cultural fidelity and to evaluate their explanatory import. I argue that cultural evolutionists use several fidelity concepts (episodic, propensity, and generalized fidelity), concepts that I will define and clarify. The second objective is to challenge the explanatory significance of a general notion of fidelity (generalized fidelity) as being both explanatorily meaningful and operationalizable. I conclude that if fidelity is to serve as an explanation of the key differences between human cumulative cultures and non-human non-cumulative traditions, then the concept will have to be redesigned and rely on different assumptions. 1Introduction2Generalized Fidelity2.1The need for an explanatory concept of fidelity2.2Three conditions for a general notion of cultural fidelity3Episodic Fidelity 3.1Measuring episodic fidelity3.2The relevance problem3.3Explanatory pluralism3.4The incommensurability of fidelity metrics4Propensity Fidelity5Fidelity as an Explanatory Concept 5.1Explaining cultural stability5.2Explaining human distinctiveness6Conclusion},

These include size differences, creating chromosomal heteromorphism, and loss of gene functions from one member of the chromosome pair. Such characteristics and changes have been widely reviewed, and underlie molecular genetic approaches that can detect sex chromosome regions. This review deals mainly with the evolution of new non-recombining regions, focusing on how certain evolutionary situations select for suppressed recombination (rather than the proximate mechanisms causing suppressed recombination between sex chromosomes). Particularly important is the likely involvement of sexually antagonistic polymorphisms in genome regions closely linked to sex-determining loci. These may be responsible for the evolutionary strata of sex chromosomes that have repeatedly formed by recombination suppression evolving across large genome regions. More studies of recently evolved non-recombining sex-determining regions should help to test this hypothesis empirically, and may provide evidence about whether other situations can sometimes lead to sex-linked regions evolving. Similarities with other non-recombining genome regions are discussed briefly, to illustrate common features of the different cases, though no general properties apply to all of them.

A crucial unresolved question is how far these genetic constraints have coevolved with language, perhaps resulting in a highly specialized and species-specific language "module," and how much language acquisition and processing redeploy preexisting cognitive machinery. In the present work, we explored the circumstances under which genes encoding language-specific properties could have coevolved with language itself. We present a theoretical model, implemented in computer simulations, of key aspects of the interaction of genes and language. Our results show that genes for language could have coevolved only with highly stable aspects of the linguistic environment; a rapidly changing linguistic environment does not provide a stable target for natural selection. Thus, a biological endowment could not coevolve with properties of language that began as learned cultural conventions, because cultural conventions change much more rapidly than genes. We argue that this rules out the possibility that arbitrary properties of language, including abstract syntactic principles governing phrase structure, case marking, and agreement, have been built into a "language module" by natural selection. The genetic basis of human language acquisition and processing did not coevolve with language, but primarily predates the emergence of language. As suggested by Darwin, the fit between language and its underlying mechanisms arose because language has evolved to fit the human brain, rather than the reverse. \textcopyright{} 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {Some cultural evolution researchers have argued for the importance of prestige bias as a systematic and widespread social learning bias, that structures human social learning and cultural transmission patterns. Broadly speaking, prestige bias accounts understand it as a bias towards copying 'prestigious' individuals (which are typically described as high-status, due to a high level of skill or success in a socially valued domain, and so are treated by others with respect and deference). Prestige bias, along with other social learning biases, has been argued to pay a crucial role in allowing cumulative cultural selection to take place, thereby generating adaptations that are key to our success as a species. However, I argue for skepticism about the plausibility and scope of a prestige bias account. I argue that although an account of prestige bias seems plausible or compelling on their face, it is committed to a particular view of the cognition underpinning the bias, and therefore to predictions regarding its flexibility and context-sensitivity. Given this, current empirical evidence gives us reason to doubt the explanatory value of a prestige bias account over a naive, goal-directed agent account. Additionally, the way that prestige is defined in empirical work is in tension with a general understanding of prestige, casting doubt upon its status as evidence of prestige bias. I examine two studies cited as evidence of prestige bias, arguing that in these cases we cannot clearly favour a prestige bias explanation over a goal-directed agent explanation.}

In addition to the scrambled images, there were four other types of test image: symmetric, in which one part of the image was a reflection of another around an axis; repetitive, in which one part of the image was a copy of the other; anti-symmetric, similar to symmetric but with the contrast of one side reversed; and interleaved patterns, in which half of the symmetric pattern was replaced by a scrambled image. The number of axes ranged from 1 to 16 for all image types. The task of our 20 observers was to give a preference rating to each image on a 6-point Lickert scale. The preference rating increased with the number of axes for all stimulus types. The observers showed a similar preference for symmetric and repetitive patterns and slightly less preference for anti-symmetric patterns. The preference for interleaved patterns was much less than for other types of stimuli. Preference for an image cannot be explained by either the ecological significance of its content or the slope of its amplitude spectrum. Instead, preference can be accounted for by the complexity of the image.},

This study probes another untapped resource for helminthic therapy: the methods and outcomes reported by individuals currently self-treating with helminths. Procedures. Helminth providers were interviewed, surveys were collected from self-treaters, and publically available information was compiled. Results. More than 250 anecdotal experiences of self-treatment were assessed, and the total number of individuals worldwide currently self-treating was estimated at between 6,000 and 7,000. A wide range of inflammation- related diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, and autoimmunity, were effectively treated. Conclusions. This study finds that the therapy is being refined through experience and is now expanding to treat widespread neuropsychiatric problems such as depression, anxiety, migraine headaches, bipolar disorder, and perhaps Parkinson's disease.},

Yi also says that she has little energy and is having a difficult time balancing school and family obligations. Although she does not spontaneously use emotional terms to describe how she feels, when asked she agrees that she is unhappy and anxious. All these symptoms are consistent with DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). And yet Yi reports other symptoms that are not typi-cally associated with major depression. She describes bodily aches and pains, espe-cially in her stomach and liver. She has become particularly concerned about what other people think of her, making it hard for her to get along with her family. Finally, she reports that at night, the spirit of a disgruntled ancestor visits her, right before she is about to fall sleep. These encounters sap her energy. Although she says that she knows other people who have been visited by spirits, she is nonetheless concerned about experiencing these visits herself. Cases like Yi's raise questions about how culture shapes the experience and expression of depression, with clear implications for assessment and treatment. On the one hand, diag-nosable major depression is observed across cultural contexts, albeit with varying preva-lence rates (Bromet et al., 2011). It disrupts lives worldwide, posing significant threats to people's productivity and well-being. Indeed, depression is projected to become a leading contributor to the global burden of disease by 2030 (Lopez \& Mathers, 2006; see Kessler et al., Chapter 1, this volume). Given the costs of depression for individual sufferers and for society as a whole, it is tempting to rely on dominant Western 1 models of conceptu-alizing, assessing, and treating this disorder in cultural contexts that, like Hmong con-texts, do not conceptualize its symptoms in the same way.

Whatever we look at, the things we see will have some feature variability: even snow is not purely white but has a range of shades of white. However, in most studies investigating visual perception, homogeneous displays with all stimuli having a very limited range of features have been used. In contrast, recent studies using heterogeneous displays have shown that our perceptual system encodes surprisingly detailed information about stimuli, representing parameters such as the mean, variance, and most importantly the probability density functions of feature distributions. Learning the parameters of the distributions takes time as distribution representations are continuously updated with incoming information. However, the mechanisms guiding this process are not yet known. We will review current knowledge about the sampling and updating of representations of feature distributions in heterogeneous displays and will present new findings providing further insights into this process. Overall, the results show that representations of distributions can be remarkably detailed and shed light on how the information provided affects the learning of feature distributions. Observers' ability to quickly encode the probability density function of distributions in the environment may potentially provide novel interpretations of a number of well-known phenomena in visual perception.},

This has led to the treatment of culture as an evolutionary process, with cultural evolutionary theory arguing that culture exhibits the three fundamental components of Darwinian evolution: variation, competition, and inheritance.2, 3, 4, 5 Selection for more efficient behaviors over alternatives is a crucial component of cumulative cultural evolution,6 yet our understanding of how and when such cultural selection occurs in non-human animals is limited. We performed a cultural diffusion experiment using 18 captive populations of wild-caught great tits (Parus major) to ask whether more efficient foraging traditions are selected for, and whether this process is affected by a fundamental demographic process\textemdash population turnover. Our results showed that gradual replacement of individuals with naive immigrants greatly increased the probability that a more efficient behavior invaded a population's cultural repertoire and outcompeted an established inefficient behavior. Fine-scale, automated behavioral tracking revealed that turnover did not increase innovation rates, but instead acted on adoption rates, as immigrants disproportionately sampled novel, efficient behaviors relative to available social information. These results provide strong evidence for cultural selection for efficiency in animals, and highlight the mechanism that links population turnover to this process.},

  abstract = {Animals employing acoustic signals, such as birds, must effectively communicate over both background noise and potentially attenuating objects in the environment. To surmount these obstacles, animals evolve species-specific acoustic signals that do not overlap with sources of interference (such as songs of close relatives), and issue these songs from locations that maximize transmission. In multispecies assemblages of birds, the acoustic resource may thus be interspecifically partitioned along multiple axes, including song perch height and signal space. However, very few such studies have focused on open habitats, where differences in sound transmission patterns and limited availability of song perches may drive competition across multiple axes within signal space. Here, we demonstrate acoustic signal space partitioning in four sympatric species of wren-warbler (Cisticolidae, {$<$}em{$>$}Prinia{$<$}/em{$>$}), in an Indian dry deciduous scrub-grassland habitat. We found that the breeding songs of the four species partition acoustic signal space, resulting in interspecific community organization. Within each species' signal space, we uncovered different intraspecific patterns in note diversity. Two species partition intraspecific signal space into multiple note types, whereas the other two vary note repetition rate to different extents. Finally, we found that the four species also partition song perch heights, thus exhibiting acoustic niche separation along multiple axes. We hypothesize that divergent song perch heights may be driven by competition for higher singing perches or other ecological factors rather than signal propagation. Acoustic signal partitioning along multiple axes may therefore arise from a combination of diverse ecological processes.}

Overall, Louisiana vowels showed patterns consistent with previously reported characteristics of Southern vowels that reflect ongoing changes in the Southern dialect (no evidence of acoustic reversal of tense-lax pairs, more specifically no peripheralization of front vowels). Some dialect-specific patterns were also observed (a relatively lesser degree of formant changes and slightly shorter vowel duration). These patterns were consistent across different regions within Louisiana.}

We demonstrate that repulsion biases are stronger when two items are highly similar, and these biases grow stronger over time as memory noise increases. Importantly, subjects with better memory performance exhibit stronger repulsion biases \textendash{} suggesting that biases are not due to a lack of effort but instead confer a functional benefit. By contrast, we find attraction biases when there are more target items than can be remembered with high accuracy (e.g., four instead of two items). Together, these results suggest that repulsion biases reflect a balance between accurate representation and increased inter-item distinctiveness, while attraction biases act to stabilize weak memory signals by capitalizing on information about the entire group of items. Due to resolution and capacity limits, human memory systems are not optimized to accurately represent remembered items; instead, representations are systematically distorted to support specific behavioral goals.},

Three nested subtypes of populational models can be distinguished: evolutionary, selectional and replicative. Substantial progress has been made in the study of cultural evolution by modelling it within the selectional frame. This progress has involved idealizing away from phenomena that may be critical to an adequate understanding of culture and cultural evolution, particularly the constructive aspect of the mechanisms of cultural transmission. Taking these aspects into account, we describe cultural evolution in terms of cultural attraction, which is populational and evolutionary, but only selectional under certain circumstances. As such, in order to model cultural evolution, we must not simply adjust existing replicative or selectional models but we should rather generalize them, so that, just as replicator-based selection is one form that Darwinian selection can take, selection itself is one of several different forms that attraction can take.

  abstract = {Culture pervades human life and is at the origin of the success of our species. A wide range of other animals have culture too, but often in a limited form that does not complexify through the gradual accumulation of innovations. We developed a new paradigm to study cultural evolution in primates in order to better evaluate our closest relatives' cultural capacities. Previous studies using transmission chain experimental paradigms, in which the behavioural output of one individual becomes the target behaviour for the next individual in the chain, show that cultural transmission can lead to the progressive emergence of systematically structured behaviours in humans. Inspired by this work, we combined a pattern reproduction task on touch screens with an iterated learning procedure to develop transmission chains of baboons (Papio papio). Using this procedure, we show that baboons can exhibit three fundamental aspects of human cultural evolution: a progressive increase in performance, the emergence of systematic structure and the presence of lineage specificity. Our results shed new light on human uniqueness: we share with our closest relatives essential capacities to produce human-like cultural evolution.},

  abstract = {In biology, natural selection is the main explanation of adaptations and it is an attractive idea to think that an analogous force could have the same role in cultural evolution. In support of this idea, all the main ingredients for natural selection have been documented in the cultural domain. However, the changes that occur during cultural transmission typically result in convergent transformation, non-random cultural modifications, casting some doubts on the importance of natural selection in the cultural domain. To progress on this issue more empirical research is needed. Here, using nearly half a million experimental trials performed by a group of baboons (Papio papio), we simulate cultural evolution under various conditions of natural selection and do an additional experiment to tease apart the role of convergent transformation and selection. Our results confirm that transformation strongly constrain the variation available to selection and therefore strongly limit its impact on cultural evolution. Surprisingly, in our study, transformation also enhances the effect of selection by stabilising cultural variation. We conclude that, in culture, selection can change the evolutionary trajectory substantially in some cases, but can only act on the variation provided by (typically biased) transformation.},

Therefore, the relationship between dispersal ability and speciation rates can be positive or negative. Furthermore, an `intermediate dispersal' model that combines positive and negative effects predicts a unimodal relationship between dispersal and diversification. Because both dispersal ability and speciation rates are difficult to quantify, empirical evidence for the relationship between dispersal and diversification remains scarce. Using a surrogate for flight performance and a species-level DNA-based phylogeny of a large South American bird radiation (the Furnariidae), we found that lineages with higher dispersal ability experienced lower speciation rates. We propose that the degree of fragmentation or permeability of the geographical setting together with the intermediate dispersal model are crucial in reconciling previous, often contradictory findings regarding the relationship between dispersal and diversification.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics, where a change in the input is not proportional to a change in the output, are often found throughout nature, for example in biochemical kinetics. Because of the complex suite of interacting abiotic and biotic variables present in ecosystems, animal population dynamics are often thought to be driven in a nonlinear, state-dependent fashion. However, so far these have only been identified in model organisms and some natural systems. Here we show that nonlinear population dynamics are ubiquitous in nature. We use nonlinear forecasting to analyse 747 datasets of 228 species to find that insect population trends were highly nonlinear (74\%), followed by mammals (58\%), bony fish (49\%) and birds (35\%). This indicates that linear, equilibrium-based model assumptions may fail at predicting population dynamics across a wide range of animal taxa. We show that faster-reproducing animals are more likely to have nonlinear and high-dimensional dynamics, supporting past ecological theory. Lastly, only a third of time series were predictable beyond two years; therefore, the ability to predict animal population trends using these methods may be limited. Our results suggest that the complex dynamics necessary to cause regime shifts and other transitions may be inherent in a wide variety of animals.}

DNA was amplified from shed hair collected from sites across the range of the three traditionally recognized gorilla subspecies: western lowland (G. g. gorilla), eastern lowland (G. g. graueri) and mountain (G. g. beringei) gorillas. Nucleotide sequence variation was examined in the first hypervariable domain of the mitochondrial control region and was much higher in western lowland gorillas than in either of the other two subspecies. In addition to recapitulating the major evolutionary split between eastern and western lowland gorillas, phylogenetic analysis indicates a phylogeographical division within western lowland gorillas, one haplogroup comprising gorilla populations from eastern Nigeria through to southeast Cameroon and a second comprising all other western lowland gorillas. Within this second haplogroup, haplotypes appear to be partitioned geographically into three subgroups: (i) Equatorial Guinea, (ii) Central African Republic, and (iii) Gabon and adjacent Congo. There is also evidence of limited haplotype admixture in northeastern Gabon and southeast Cameroon. The phylogeographical patterns are broadly consistent with those predicted by current Pleistocene refuge hypotheses for the region and suggest that historical events have played an important role in shaping the population structure of this subspecies.},

Two linguistic laws\textemdash Menzerath's Law (which states that longer sequences consist of shorter constituents) and Zipf's Law of abbreviation (a negative relationship between signal length and frequency of use)\textemdash are predictions of compression. It has been proposed that compression is a universal in animal communication, but there have been mixed results, particularly in reference to Zipf's Law of abbreviation. Like songbirds, male gibbons (\emph{Hylobates muelleri}) engage in long solo bouts with unique combinations of notes which combine into phrases. We found strong support for Menzerath's Law as the longer a phrase, the shorter the notes. To identify phrase types, we used state-of-the-art affinity propagation clustering, and were able to predict phrase types using support vector machines with a mean accuracy of 74\%. Based on unsupervised phrase type classification, we did not find support for Zipf's Law of abbreviation. Our results indicate that adherence to linguistic laws in male gibbon solos depends on the unit of analysis. We conclude that principles of compression are applicable outside of human language, but may act differently across levels of organization in biological systems.}

Here, we investigated individuality and patterns of geographic variation across a small geographic scale (ca. 10 km) in female Bornean gibbon (Hylobates muelleri) great calls. We analyzed calls recorded from wild, unhabituated gibbon groups at the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems site in Sabah, Malaysia. We estimated 23 acoustic features in 376 great calls from 33 different females. We used linear discriminant function analysis to investigate intra- and interindividual variation in great calls. To examine small-scale patterns of geographic variation great calls we investigated measures of acoustic dissimilarity as a function of distance. We found that temporal features (such as the duration of the notes and the duration of rest between notes) contributed substantially to individuality. We were able to identify females based on their calls with 95.7\% accuracy using leave-one-out cross-validation. We found no discernible patterns of geographic variation at our site; females with neighboring territories were just as likely to have similar calls as females with more distant territories. It is possible that we did not sample across a large enough geographic range, or that substantial interindividual variation effectively swamped across-site patterns of variation. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence for individual vocal signatures in primates and mammals, but further research is needed to understand the evolutionary mechanisms that contribute to individuality in gibbon calls.},

Self-reported physical health status varied by gender and by sexual orientation. CONCLUSIONS: Lesbians and bisexual and homosexually experienced heterosexual women reported a greater variety of health conditions and limitations compared with exclusively heterosexual women; however, these differences mostly disappeared when distress levels were taken into account.

Using 90 inventory plots across intact, lowland, terra firme, Amazonian forests and a new phylogeny including 526 angiosperm genera, we investigated the association between taxonomic and evolutionary metrics of diversity and two key measures of ecosystem function: aboveground wood productivity and biomass storage. While taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity were not important predictors of variation in biomass, both emerged as independent predictors of wood productivity. Amazon forests that contain greater evolutionary diversity and a higher proportion of rare species have higher productivity. While climatic and edaphic variables are together the strongest predictors of productivity, our results show that the evolutionary diversity of tree species in diverse forest stands also influences productivity. As our models accounted for wood density and tree size, they also suggest that additional, unstudied, evolutionarily correlated traits have significant effects on ecosystem function in tropical forests. Overall, our pan-Amazonian analysis shows that greater phylogenetic diversity translates into higher levels of ecosystem function: tropical forest communities with more distantly related taxa have greater wood productivity.}

Recording and analysis of USVs has broad utility during diverse behavioral tests and can be performed noninvasively in almost any rodent behavioral model to provide rich insights into the emotional state and motor function of the test animal. Despite strong evidence that USVs serve an array of communicative functions, technical and financial limitations have been barriers for most laboratories to adopt vocalization analysis. Recently, deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine hearing and vision, by allowing computers to perform human-like activities including seeing, listening, and speaking. Such systems are constructed from biomimetic, ``deep'', artificial neural networks. Here, we present DeepSqueak, a USV detection and analysis software suite that can perform human quality USV detection and classification automatically, rapidly, and reliably using cutting-edge regional convolutional neural network architecture (Faster-RCNN). DeepSqueak was engineered to allow non-experts easy entry into USV detection and analysis yet is flexible and adaptable with a graphical user interface and offers access to numerous input and analysis features. Compared to other modern programs and manual analysis, DeepSqueak was able to reduce false positives, increase detection recall, dramatically reduce analysis time, optimize automatic syllable classification, and perform automatic syntax analysis on arbitrarily large numbers of syllables, all while maintaining manual selection review and supervised classification. DeepSqueak allows USV recording and analysis to be added easily to existing rodent behavioral procedures, hopefully revealing a wide range of innate responses to provide another dimension of insights into behavior when combined with conventional outcome measures.},

  abstract = {Contrary to the conventional assumption that humans perceive shapes of rigid objects as constant despite retinal-image variations caused by changes in orientation and position, we show that the depths of three-dimensional (3-D) textured shapes appear to vary when the image is rotated. In paired comparisons of static stimuli, depth amplitude was perceived to be greater at vertical than at oblique orientations. A similar oblique bias was found for simple two-dimensional (2-D) obtuse angles. Using projective geometry to link angle magnitude to the orientation flows that convey 3-D shape from texture cues, we show quantitatively that the 2-D bias predicts the 3-D bias. Our finding that perception of angular magnitude is dependent on orientation has broad implications for shape constancy because orientation flows have also been implicated in 3-D perception from reflections and shading, and contour curvature is fundamental to uncovering depth and part-structure of shapes. We examined the roles played in the observed biases by anisotropies in numbers and tuning widths of orientation-tuned cells in striate cortex as well as the distribution of oriented energy in natural scenes. An optimal stimulus decoding model for 2-D angles revealed that the narrower tuning of cells for horizontal orientations combined with cross-orientation inhibition explains the orientation-dependent angle distortion and hence the 3-D shape inconstancy. Variations in properties within neural populations can thus have direct effects on visual perceptions and need to be included in neural decoding models.},

  abstract = {Symmetry is a biologically relevant, mathematically involving, and aesthetically compelling visual phenomenon. Mirror symmetry detection is considered particularly rapid and efficient, based on experiments with random noise. Symmetry detection in natural settings, however, is often accomplished against structured backgrounds. To measure salience of symmetry in diverse contexts, we assembled mirror symmetric patterns from 101 natural textures. Temporal thresholds for detecting the symmetry axis ranged from 28 to 568 ms indicating a wide range of salience (1/Threshold). We built a model for estimating symmetry-energy by connecting pairs of mirror-symmetric filters that simulated cortical receptive fields. The model easily identified the axis of symmetry for all patterns. However, symmetry-energy quantified at this axis correlated weakly with salience. To examine context effects on symmetry detection, we used the same model to estimate approximate symmetry resulting from the underlying texture throughout the image. Magnitudes of approximate symmetry at flanking and orthogonal axes showed strong negative correlations with salience, revealing context interference with symmetry detection. A regression model that included the context-based measures explained the salience results, and revealed why perceptual symmetry can differ from mathematical characterizations. Using natural patterns thus produces new insights into symmetry perception and its possible neural circuits.},

Many analyses of birdsong require time-consuming manual annotation of the individual elements of song, known as syllables or notes. Here we describe the first automated algorithm for birdsong annotation that is applicable to complex song such as canary song. We developed a neural network architecture, ``TweetyNet'', that is trained with a small amount of hand-labeled data using supervised learning methods. We first show TweetyNet achieves significantly lower error on Bengalese finch song than a similar method, using less training data, and maintains low error rates across days. Applied to canary song, TweetyNet achieves fully automated annotation of canary song, accurately capturing the complex statistical structure previously discovered in a manually annotated dataset. We conclude that TweetyNet will make it possible to ask a wide range of new questions focused on complex songs where manual annotation was impractical.},

  abstract = {Songbirds provide a powerful model system for studying sensory-motor learning. However, many analyses of birdsong require time-consuming, manual annotation of its elements, called syllables. Automated methods for annotation have been proposed, but these methods assume that audio can be cleanly segmented into syllables, or they require carefully tuning multiple statistical models. Here, we present TweetyNet: a single neural network model that learns how to segment spectrograms of birdsong into annotated syllables. We show that TweetyNet mitigates limitations of methods that rely on segmented audio. We also show that TweetyNet performs well across multiple individuals from two species of songbirds, Bengalese finches and canaries. Lastly, we demonstrate that using TweetyNet we can accurately annotate very large datasets containing multiple days of song, and that these predicted annotations replicate key findings from behavioral studies. In addition, we provide open-source software to assist other researchers, and a large dataset of annotated canary song that can serve as a benchmark. We conclude that TweetyNet makes it possible to address a wide range of new questions about birdsong.},

  abstract = {Cognition has been studied intensively for several decades, but the evolutionary processes that shape individual variation in cognitive traits remain elusive [1-3]. For instance, the strength of selection on a cognitive trait has never been estimated in a natural population, and the possibility that positive links with life history variation [1-5] are mitigated by costs [6] or confounded by ecological factors remains unexplored in the wild. We assessed novel problem-solving performance in 468 wild great tits Parus major temporarily taken into captivity and subsequently followed up their reproductive performance in the wild. Problem-solver females produced larger clutches than nonsolvers. This benefit did not arise because solvers timed their breeding better, occupied better habitats, or compromised offspring quality or their own survival. Instead, foraging range size and day length were relatively small and short, respectively, for solvers, suggesting that they were more efficient at exploiting their environment. In contrast to the positive effect on clutch size, problem solvers deserted their nests more often, leading to little or no overall selection on problem-solving performance. Our results are consistent with the idea that variation in cognitive ability is shaped by contrasting effects on different life history traits directly linked to fitness [1, 3]. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study concerns depression among women living in developing and developed parts of the world. Using a continuum of environments conceptualized as ranging from traditional to modern, the goal is to explore the hypothesis that the prevalence of depression will be higher among those living in modern compared to traditional societies. This issue is examined among samples from West Africa and North America. METHODS: The subjects are 657 women who reside in four locations. An operational definition of modernization is used to place the locales as a continuum in the following order: rural Yorubaland in Nigeria, Yorubas living in urban Nigeria, rural Canada, and urban United States. Variables employed include education, religious orientation, and the role of women as mothers and workers. Depression is assessed using an algorithm based on generally acknowledged criteria. Multivariate logistic regression is used to generate point estimates and confidence intervals for prevalence odds ratios, to adjust for potential confounders, and to assess effect modification. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression was lowest among rural Nigerians and highest among urban residents in the United States. The association of depression with the proposed continuum was strongest among women under the age of 45 who had living children (Odds Ratio: 2.1; 95\% Confidence Interval: 1.6-2.9). CONCLUSIONS: In the areas studied, a traditional way of life seems to offer protection against some of the stresses associated with modernization although it does not appear to compensate for the adversity of childlessness. Level of modernization may be a useful concept for understanding differences in rates of depression in different parts of the world.},

  abstract = {Homoiologies are phylogenetically misleading morphological similarities that are due to nongenetic factors. It has been claimed that homoiologies are common in the hominin skull, especially in regions affected by masticatory strain, and that their prevalence is one reason why reconstructing hominin phylogenetic relationships is difficult. To evaluate this ``homoiology hypothesis,'' we performed analyses on a group of extant primates for which a robust molecular phylogeny is available\textemdash the hominoids. We compiled a data set from measurements that developmental considerations and experimental evidence suggest differ in their likelihood of exhibiting masticatory-strain-induced phenotypic plasticity. We then used the coefficient of variation and t-tests to evaluate the phenotypic plasticity of the measurements. We predicted that, if the hypothesis is correct, the measurements of skeletal features that do not remodel and therefore are unaffected by phenotypic plasticity should be less variable than the measurements of skeletal features that remodel and are subject to low-to-moderate strains, and that the latter should be less variable than the measurements of skeletal features that remodel and are subject to moderate-to-high strains. Subsequently, we performed phylogenetic analyses on character state data derived from the measurements and compared the resulting phylogenetic hypotheses to the consensus molecular phylogeny for the hominoids. We predicted that, if the hypothesis is correct, agreement between the phylogenies should be best for the non-phenotypically-plastic characters, intermediate for the low-to-moderate-strain characters, and worst for the moderate-to-high-strain characters. The results of the coefficient of variation/t-test analyses were consistent with the predictions of the hypothesis to the extent that the moderate-to-high-strain measurements exhibited significantly more variability than the non-phenotypically-plastic and low-to-moderate-strain measurements. In contrast, the results of the phylogenetic analyses were not those predicted. The phylogeny derived from the moderate-to-high-strain characters matched the molecular phylogeny better than those obtained using the non-phenotypically-plastic and low-to-moderate-strain characters. Thus, our study supports the suggestion that mechanical loading results in phenotypic plasticity in the hominin skull, but it does not support the notion that homoiologies have a significant negative impact on hominin phylogenetics.}

Increases in cultural complexity are claimed to result from increases in population size; decreases in cultural complexity are suggested to be due to decreases in population size; and periods of no change are attributed to low numbers or frequent extirpation. In this paper, we argue that this approach is not defensible. We show that the available empirical evidence does not support the idea that cultural complexity in hunter-gatherers is governed by population size. Instead, ethnographic and archaeological data suggest that hunter-gatherer cultural complexity is most strongly influenced by environmental factors. Because all hominins were hunter-gatherers until the Holocene, this means using population size to interpret patterns in the Palaeolithic archaeological record is problematic. In future, the population size hypothesis should be viewed as one of several competing hypotheses and its predictions formally tested alongside those of its competitors.This article is part of the themed issue 'Major transitions in human evolution'.},

There are few empirical examples of how differences in collective dynamics emerge from variation among individuals in cognition.

We artificially selected two distinct phenotypes: high-LI bees that ignore previously familiar stimuli in favor of novel ones and low-LI bees that learn familiar and novel stimuli equally well. We then provided colonies differentially composed of different ratios of these phenotypes with a choice between familiar and novel feeders. Colonies of predominantly high-LI individuals preferred to visit familiar food locations, while low-LI colonies visited novel and familiar food locations equally. Interestingly, in colonies of mixed learning phenotypes, the low-LI individuals showed a preference to visiting familiar feeders, which contrasts with their behavior when in a uniform low-LI group. We show that the shift in feeder preference of low-LI bees is driven by foragers of the high-LI phenotype dancing more intensely and attracting more followers. Our results reveal that cognitive abilities of individuals and their social interactions, which we argue relate to differences in attention, drive emergent collective outcomes.}

However, we lack a theoretical framework that can explain why division of labour has evolved on certain branches of the tree of life but not others. Here, we model the division of labour over a cooperative behaviour, considering both when it should evolve and the extent to which the different types should become specialized. We found that: (1) division of labour is usually\textemdash but not always\textemdash favoured by high efficiency benefits to specialization and low within-group conflict; and (2) natural selection favours extreme specialization, where some individuals are completely dependent on the helping behaviour of others. We make a number of predictions, several of which are supported by the existing empirical data, from microbes and animals, while others suggest novel directions for empirical work. More generally, we show how division of labour can lead to mutual dependence between different individuals and hence drive major evolutionary transitions, such as those to multicellularity and eusociality.},

There is, however, no consensus about the developmental origins or functional basis of this phenomenon. Here, we report the analysis of a large library of digitized scenes using image processing with orientation-sensitive filters. Our re-sults show a prevalence of vertical and horizontal orientations in indoor, outdoor, and even entirely natural settings. Because visual experience is known to inf luence the development of visual cortical circuitry, we suggest that this real world anisotropy is related to the enhanced ability of humans and other animals to process contours in the cardinal axes, perhaps by stimulating the development of a greater amount of visual circuitry devoted to processing vertical and horizon-tal contours. Humans and other animals process information at or near the vertical and horizontal meridians more efficiently than infor-mation projected onto the retina at oblique angles. This phenomenon\textemdash called the ''oblique effect''\textemdash has been docu-mented by differences in acuity, contrast sensitivity, orienta-tion discrimination, and recognition rate (1, 2). In addition to humans, species as diverse as octopuses, goldfish, rats, cats, and chimpanzees show the oblique effect to some degree (2). Despite the prevalence of this perceptual bias, there is little or no consensus about how or why it occurs or what significance it has for human vision (see, for example, ref. 3). Although contours in the visual environment obviously are distributed across the full range of orientations, it is possible that the visual system has been biased functionally and struc-turally by a predominance of visible contours near the cardinal axes. In fact, natural vistas have predictable frequency and chromatic characteristics (4, 5), and an earlier study using optical Fourier analysis has shown that a variety of scenes have anisotropic frequency spectra, with more power near the cardinal axes (6; see also ref. 7). Despite these intriguing reports, the distribution of oriented feature contours projected onto the retina by representative objects has never been determined in a way that would allow ready comparison of the distribution of orientations within and between different visual environments. Accordingly, we have examined a large number of real world scenes, taking advantage of recent advances in image analysis to measure the distribution of oriented projec-tions that the visual system must process.},

Recalled sequences from one participant become training data for the next participant. In this way, we simulate cultural evolution in the laboratory.

Here, we present convex hull volume, a construct from computational geometry, which provides an n-dimensional measure of the volume of trait space occupied by species in a community. Combined with ecological null models, this measure offers a useful test for habitat filtering. We use convex hull volume and a null model to analyze California woody-plant trait and community data. Our results show that observed plant communities occupy less trait space than expected from random assembly, a result consistent with habitat filtering.},

Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to assess the relationship between femininity and PMS. Statistically significant correlations were found between T-scores for femininity on the Bem Sex Role Inventory (Bem, 1978) and total distress scores on the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (Moos, 1991). Analysis of the qualitative data suggests that women engage in intense premenstrual bodily surveillance, and the data support Ussher, Hunter, and Browne's (2000) findings that the 'PMS self' becomes lived as an identity position in contrast to a 'real' or 'non-PMS sell.' The authors conclude that our biopsychiatric discourse about PMS functions to legitimize traditional constructions of femininity and that future research should conceptualize menstrual distress as both lived experience and social construction.},

Here we review progress made on behavioral differences in mouse models that uncouple sex chromosome complement from gonadal sex.

Declines in population density could be exacerbated by culture loss, thereby linking culture to conservation. We combined historical recordings, citizen science and breeding data to assess the impact of severe population decline on song culture, song complexity and individual fitness in critically endangered regent honeyeaters (Anthochaera phrygia). Song production in the remaining wild males varied dramatically, with 27\% singing songs that differed from the regional cultural norm. Twelve per cent of males, occurring in areas of particularly low population density, completely failed to sing any species-specific songs and instead sang other species' songs. Atypical song production was associated with reduced individual fitness, as males singing atypical songs were less likely to pair or nest than males that sang the regional cultural norm. Songs of captive-bred birds differed from those of all wild birds. The complexity of regent honeyeater songs has also declined over recent decades. We therefore provide rare evidence that a severe decline in population density is associated with the loss of vocal culture in a wild animal, with concomitant fitness costs for remaining individuals. The loss of culture may be a precursor to extinction in declining populations that learn selected behaviours from conspecifics, and therefore provides a useful conservation indicator.},

The extent to which repertoire size, the number of syllables or song types sung by a bird, is subject to sexual selection is unknown, and studies to date have provided inconsistent evidence. Here, we propose that selection pressure on the size and complexity of birdsong repertoires may facilitate the construction of a niche in which learning, sexual selection, and song-based homophily may co-evolve. We show, using a review of the birdsong literature and mathematical modeling, that learning mode (open-ended or closed-ended learning) is correlated with the size of birdsong repertoires. Underpinning this correlation may be a form of cultural niche construction in which a costly biological trait (for example, open-ended learning) can spread in a population (or be lost) as a result of direct selection on an associated cultural trait (for example, song repertoire size).

The sharp increase in long-distance transportation of lithic material between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic, for example, is seen as a manifestation of the cultural revolution that defined the transition between these epochs. Here, we propose that population interaction is not only a reflection of cultural change but also a potential driver of it. We explore the possible effects of inter-population migration on cultural evol-ution when migrating individuals possess core technological knowledge from their original population. Using a computational framework of cultural evolution that incorporates realistic aspects of human innovation processes, we show that migration can lead to a range of outcomes, including punctu-ated but transient increases in cultural complexity, an increase of cultural complexity to an elevated steady state and the emergence of a positive feed-back loop that drives ongoing acceleration in cultural accumulation. Our findings suggest that population contact may have played a crucial role in the evolution of hominin cultures and propose explanations for observations of Palaeolithic cultural change whose interpretations have been hotly debated.},

  abstract = {1 Breeding birds increase their fitness by synchronizing their production of chicks with a peak of food abundance. Synchronization is primarily achieved by varying first egg date, but yearly temperature variations may delay or accelerate the food peak after the first egg has been laid. We tested the extent to which great tits (Parus major L.) can strategically change their synchronization of hatch date with the food peak after the first egg has been laid by changing clutch size, laying interval and the amount of incubation. We also tested whether these possible synchronization change mechanisms resulted in changes in breeding success, because if the food peak is late relative to first egg date, we would predict more of the population to have larger clutches and/or a hatch date synchronous with the food peak date. 2 Great tits modified synchronization strategically by varying clutch size and the onset of incubation after clutch completion. When first egg date was early but then followed by cold weather so that the food peak was late, clutch sizes were larger, and when first egg date was late and temperatures were low, mean incubation periods were shorter if the food peak was early. 3 Over the 39-year period of the study, the period between the first egg date and food peak increased significantly by 1{$\cdot$}7 days more than the period between the food peak and hatch date. Great tits have maintained synchronization by significantly increasing their incubation period. 4 Overall, the proportion of nests that had synchronous hatch dates depended on the yearly temperature pattern: the decline in variance between date of clutch completion and hatch was significantly greater in years where prelaying temperatures were higher (i.e. early first egg dates) and has therefore increased in recent years because of climate change. In warm early seasons (and more often in recent years) more of the great tits that laid relatively late had sufficient time to complete their clutches before having to start incubation in order to hatch in time for the food peak. 5 The increased proportion of synchronized nests in recent years probably resulted in increased chick output: a greater proportion of recent nests successfully fledged all of the chicks that hatched and the number of young fledged per successful nest also increased in recent years. These changes may have arisen because the proportion of nests with disadvantageous asynchronous hatching and/or smaller clutches has decreased. As the proportion of great tits that start nesting too late to synchronize has declined so selection for early laying has also declined in recent years.},

It is notable that our primate relatives do not appear to engage in activities with all the attributes of ?music? as defined here. However, several primate behaviours and attributes might constitute precursors of musicality. In particular, it is suggested here that music may have arisen in the course of evolution in part as a result of processes of progressive altricialisation (a lengthening of the pre-reproductive juvenile period) in the primate and hominid lineages; a scenario for exploring the dynamics of altriciality in computational terms is also suggested.},

  abstract = {The paper will draw on ethnomusicological, cognitive and neuroscientific evidence in suggesting that music and language constitute complementary components of the human communicative toolkit. It will start by outlining an operational definition of music as a mode of social interaction in terms of its generic, cross-cultural properties that facilitates comparison with language as a universal human faculty. It will argue that, despite the fact that music appears much more heterogeneous and differentiated in function from culture to culture than does language, music possesses common attributes across cultures: it exploits the human capacity to entrain to external (particularly social) stimuli, and presents a rich set of semantic fields while under-determining meaning. While language is held to possess both combinatoriality and semanticity, music is often claimed to be combinatorial but to lack semanticity. This paper will argue that music has semanticity, but that this semanticity is adapted for a different function from that of language. Music exploits the human capacity for entrainment, increasing the likelihood that participants will experience a sense of `shared intentionality'. It presents the characteristics of an `honest signal' while under-specifying goals in ways that permit individuals to interact even while holding to personal interpretations of goals and meanings that may actually be in conflict. Music allows participants to explore the prospective consequences of their actions and attitudes towards others within a temporal framework that promotes the alignment of participants' sense of goals. As a generic human faculty music thus provides a medium that is adapted to situations of social uncertainty, a medium by means of which a capacity for flexible social interaction can be explored and reinforced. It will be argued that a faculty for music is likely to have been exaptive in the evolution of the human capacity for complex social interaction.},

Some taxa and sites showed decreases in abundance and diversity while others increased or were unchanged, yielding net abundance and biodiversity trends generally indistinguishable from zero. This lack of overall increase or decline was consistent across arthropod feeding groups and was similar for heavily disturbed versus relatively natural sites. The apparent robustness of US arthropod populations is reassuring. Yet, this result does not diminish the need for continued monitoring and could mask subtler changes in species composition that nonetheless endanger insect-provided ecosystem services.}

The integration effect is the finding that recognition of the melody (or text) of a song is better in the presence of the text (or melody) with which it had been heard originally than in the presence of a different text (or melody). One explanation for this finding is the physical interaction hypothesis, which holds that one component of a song exerts subtle but memorable physical changes on the other component, making the latter different from what it would be with a different companion. In Experiments 1 and 2, we investigated the influence that words could exert on the subtle musical character of a melody. A second explanation for the integration effect is the association-by-contiguity hypothesis, which holds that any two events experienced in close temporal proximity may become connected in memory such that each acts as a recall cue for the other. In Experiment 3, we investigated the degree to which simultaneous presentations of spoken text with a hummed melody would induce an association between the two components. The results gave encouragement for both explanations and are discussed in terms of the distinction between encoding specificity and independent associative bonding.},

A well-trod debate at the nexus of cognitive science and linguistics, the so-called past tense debate, has examined how rules and exceptions are individually acquired (McClelland \& Patterson, ; Pinker \& Ullman, ). However, this debate focuses primarily on individual mechanisms in learning, saying little about how rules and exceptions function from a sociolinguistic perspective. To remedy this, we use agent-based models to examine how rules and exceptions function across populations. We expand on earlier work by considering how repeated interaction and cultural transmission across speakers affects the dynamics of rules and exceptions in language, measuring linguistic outcomes within a social system rather than focusing individual learning outcomes. We consider how population turnover and growth effect linguistic rule dynamics in large and small populations, showing that this method has considerable potential particularly in probing the mechanisms underlying the linguistic niche hypothesis (Lupyan \& Dale, ).},

  abstract = {When personally gathered and socially acquired information conflict, animals often prioritize private information. We propose that this is because private information often contains details that social information lacks. We test this idea in an ant model. Ants using a food source learn its location and quality rapidly (private information), whereas pheromone trails (social information) provide good directional information, but lack reliable information about food quality. If this lack is indeed responsible for the choice of memory over pheromone trails, adding information that better food is available should cause foragers to switch their priority to social information. We show it does: while ants follow memory rather than pheromones when they conflict, adding unambiguous information about a better potential food source (a 2 \textmu l droplet of good food) reverses this pattern, from 60\% of ants following their memory to 75\% following the pheromone trail. Using fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that food (and thus information) flows from fed workers to outgoing foragers, explaining the frequent contacts of ants on trails. Ants trained to poor food that contact nest-mates fed with good food are more likely to follow a trail than ants which received information about poor food. We conclude that social information may often be ignored because it lacks certain crucial dimensions, suggesting that information content is crucial for understanding how and when animals prioritize social and private information.}

  abstract = {The dynamics of social networks can determine the transmission of information, the spread of diseases, and the evolution of behavior. Despite this broad importance, a general framework for predicting social network stability has not been proposed. Here we present longitudinal data on the social dynamics of a cooperative bird species, the wire-tailed manakin, to evaluate the potential causes of temporal network stability. We find that when partners interact less frequently and when social connectedness increases, the network is subsequently less stable. Social connectivity was also negatively associated with the temporal persistence of coalition partnerships on an annual timescale. This negative association between connectivity and stability was surprising, especially given that individual manakins who were more connected also had more stable partnerships. This apparent paradox arises from a within-individual behavioral trade-off between partnership quantity and quality. Crucially, this trade-off is easily masked by behavioral variation among individuals. Using a simulation, we show that these results are explained by a simple model that combines among-individual behavioral heterogeneity and reciprocity within the network. As social networks become more connected, individuals face a trade-off between partnership quantity and maintenance. This model also demonstrates how among-individual behavioral heterogeneity, a ubiquitous feature of natural societies, can improve social stability. Together, these findings provide unifying principles that are expected to govern diverse social systems.},

A transmission chain experiment validates a model of the emergence of local traditions, indicating that such social transmission may lead initially neutral traits to become adaptive, hence strongly selecting for copying and conformity. Although this situation was suggested decades ago, it previously had little empirical support.},

The difficulties of crafting sound policy, however, are pronounced for large terrestrial carnivores. Systems in which humans and carnivores share space are characterized by high mortality of carnivores, threats to human safety, economic loss, and political conflicts (Treves 2009; Ripple et al. 2014; Darimont et al. 2015). Despite common and substantial data deficiencies, estimates of abundance and trend are often central in justifying controversial policies such as hunting, lethal control, and strict protections. Given the political conflict surrounding carnivore population protection or reduction (Nie 2004; Chapron \& L\'opez-Bao 2014), we contend that reporting of population data (abundance and trend) and associated policies are exceptionally prone to political influence. We hypothesize that some governments and other organizations justify politically preferred policies by over-or underreporting without empirical justification the size or other population data of carnivore populations, creating what we term political populations (populations with ecological attributes constructed to serve political interests). Evidence for political populations is emerging in scholarly scrutiny of government reporting on wildlife population sizes, trends, and associated policy. For example, Popescu et al.

  abstract = {Animal (and human) societies characterized by dominance hierarchies invariably suffer from inequality. The rise of inequality has 3 main prerequisites: 1) a group in which inequality can emerge, 2) the existence of differences in payoff, and 3) a mechanism that initiates, accumulates, and propagates the differences. Hitherto, 2 kinds of models have been used to study the processes involved. In winner-loser models of inequality (typical in zoology), the 3 elements are independent. In division-of-labor models of inequality, the first 2 elements are linked, whereas the third is independent. In this article, we propose a new model, that of synchronized group action, in which all 3 elements are linked. Under these conditions, agent-based simulations of communal action in multilayered communities naturally give rise to endogenous status, emergent social stratification, and the rise of elite cliques. We show that our 3 emergent social phenomena (status, stratification, and elite formation) react to natural variations in merit (the capacity to influence others' decisions). We also show that the group-level efficiency and inequality consequences of these emergent phenomena define a space for social institutions that optimize efficiency gain in some fitness-related respect, while controlling the loss of efficiency and equality in other respects.},

That is, we argue that coordination activities in larger groups become more effective when they center on symbolic (although formerly real) bearers of authority; for smaller groups, we claim the opposite occurs. Our argument is pursued by way of a collective action model that makes anthropologically plausible assumptions about human sociality. One key finding is the existence of a group-size threshold that marks the difference between the two different collective action regimes, one with and one without the presence of a deified historical figure. Another is that, in larger groups, priest-like castes naturally emerge as a consequence of the benefits of personally identifying with the deified agent.},

Then we experimentally manipulated the gut microbiome by feeding birds one of two different diets: an all insect diet or an all seed/nut diet. We presented these individuals with the problem solving task after the dietary manipulation to test whether the gut microbiome alterations influenced foraging innovativeness. Microbial communities changed substantially when given the insect, but not the seed diet. Individuals were less likely to problem solve after being given the insect diet, and performance was positively associated with microbiome diversity. This is the first demonstration of an association between innovative problem solving and the gut microbiome in a wild animal.}

Here, we first established an inefficient solution to a foraging task in five captive chimpanzee groups (N = 19). Three groups subsequently witnessed a conspecific using an alternative, more efficient, solution. When participants could successfully forage with their established behaviours, most individuals did not switch to this more efficient technique; however, when their foraging method became substantially less efficient, nine chimpanzees with socially-acquired information (four of whom witnessed additional human demonstrations) relinquished their old behaviour in favour of the more efficient one. Only a single chimpanzee in control groups, who had not witnessed a knowledgeable model, discovered this. Individuals who switched were later able to combine components of their two learned techniques to produce a more efficient solution than their extensively used, original foraging method. These results suggest that, although chimpanzees show a considerable degree of conservatism, they also have an ability to combine independent behaviours to produce efficient compound action sequences; one of the foundational abilities (or candidate mechanisms) for human cumulative culture.},

Participants were drawn from the Australian Twin Registry, and recruited from a large, partly longitudinal twin-family study. Three thousand and eighty women responded to the anonymous self-report questionnaire, including 667 complete monozygotic (MZ) pairs and 377 complete dizygotic (DZ) same-sex pairs, 366 women from complete DZ opposite-sex pairs, and 626 women whose co-twins did not participate. Significant twin correlations were found for both MZ and DZ twin pairs for all three items of interest. Age effects were statistically significant for some items. Models incorporating additive genetic, shared and nonshared environmental influences provided the best fit for Items 1 and 3, while a model with additive and nonadditive genetic influences along with nonshared environment fitted the data from Item 2. While an independent pathway model fits the data most par-simoniously, a common pathway model incorporating additive genetic (A), shared environment (C), and unique environment (E) effects cannot be ruled out. Overall, genetic influences account for approximately 31\% of the variance of frequency of orgasm during sexual intercourse, 37\% of the variance of frequency of orgasm during sexual contact other than during intercourse, and 51\% of the variance of frequency of orgasm during masturbation. Following Baker (1996), we speculate that this additive genetic variance might arise from frequency-dependent selection for a variety of female sexual strategies.},

To answer his critics, Darwin turned to sexual selection to account for the extreme development of language. Many contemporary evolutionary theorists have invoked incredibly lucky mutation or some variant of the assimilation of acquired behaviors to innate predispositions in an effort to explain it. Recent evodevo approaches have identified developmental processes that help to explain how complex functional synergies can evolve by Darwinian means. Interestingly, many of these developmental mechanisms bear a resemblance to aspects of Darwin's mechanism of natural selection, often differing only in one respect (e.g., form of duplication, kind of variation, competition/cooperation). A common feature is an interplay between processes of stabilizing selection and processes of relaxed selection at different levels of organism function. These may play important roles in the many levels of evolutionary process contributing to language. Surprisingly, the relaxation of selection at the organism level may have been a source of many complex synergistic features of the human language capacity, and may help explain why so much language information is "inherited" socially.},

  abstract = {Every language produces some type of verse in the form of songs, poems, or nursery rhymes, which can be analysed as a layer of words set to a template (e.g. a tune, a poetic metre). Verse templates typically consist of hierarchically organised sections: songs are made up of stanzas, divided into lines, containing bars, etc. We hypothesise that this kind of patterns may emerge in the process of cultural transmission; unstructured sound sequences impose a challenge to short-term memory, but chunking the input makes it easier to parse and reproduce the sequences accurately.In order to test this hypothesis, we have run an iterated learning experiment where random sequences of syllables are evolved across four transmission chains with ten generations of subjects each (all native Dutch speakers). The initial random sequences are generated by concatenating twelve tokens of the set \{ban, bi, ta, tin\}, as a way to materialise the abstract verse templates without using content-words. More precisely, the experiment aims to model the sequences of nonsense syllables used in many traditions to communicate the rhythmic patterns underlying songs (e.g. bols in Hindustani music, lalay patterns in Berber verse). Participants listened to the sequences of syllables, and tried to reproduce them using four computer keys, each mapped to one of the four syllables used in the input sequences. The relative timing of the participants' responses were normalised so that the input always consisted of completely isochronous sequences.Overall, the results show that sequences become shorter, easier to recall and more structured in the transmission process. Some regularities can be related to a global tendency to chunk the input and increase the popularity of a handful of ngrams. Besides, sequences increasingly tend to be opened by a heavy syllable (e.g. ban) and closed by a light syllable (e.g. ta), which can derive from a Dutch-specific bias.},

The deduced amino acid sequences of these pigments are highly homologous to the equivalent human pigments. None of the amino acid differences occurred at sites that were previously shown to influence pigment absorption characteristics. Therefore, we predict the spectra of red and green pigments of the apes to have wavelengths of maximum absorption that differ by {$<$} 2 nm from the equivalent human pigments and that color vision in these nonhuman primates will be very similar, if not identical, to that in humans. A total of 14 within-species polymorphisms (6 involving silent substitutions) were observed in the coding sequences of the red and green pigment genes of the great apes. Remarkably, the polymorphisms at 6 of these sites had been observed in human populations, suggesting that they predated the evolution of higher primates. Alleles at polymorphic sites were often shared between the red and green pigment genes. The average synonymous rate of divergence of red from green sequences was approximately 1/10th that estimated for other proteins of higher primates, indicating the involvement of gene conversion in generating these polymorphisms. The high degree of homology and juxtaposition of these two genes on the X chromosome has promoted unequal recombination and/or gene conversion that led to sequence homogenization. However, natural selection operated to maintain the degree of separation in peak absorbance between the red and green pigments that resulted in optimal chromatic discrimination. This represents a unique case of molecular coevolution between two homologous genes that functionally interact at the behavioral level.},

  abstract = {Social learning and life history interact in human adaptation, but nearly all models of the evolution of social learning omit age structure and population regulation. Further progress is hindered by a poor appreciation of how life history affects selection on learning. We discuss why life history and age structure are important for social learning and present an exemplary model of the evolution of social learning in which demographic properties of the population arise endogenously from assumptions about per capita vital rates and different forms of population regulation. We find that, counterintuitively, a stronger reliance on social learning is favoured in organisms characterized by `fast' life histories with high mortality and fertility rates compared to `slower' life histories typical of primates. Long lifespans make early investment in learning more profitable and increase the probability that the environment switches within generations. Both effects favour more individual learning. Additionally, under fertility regulation (as opposed to mortality regulation), more juveniles are born shortly after switches in the environment when many adults are not adapted, creating selection for more individual learning. To explain the empirical association between social learning and long life spans and to appreciate the implications for human evolution, we need further modelling frameworks allowing strategic learning and cumulative culture.

Here, we present a mathematical model of the evolution of social learning in a population with different age classes. We investigate how demographic processes affect the adaptive value of culture, cultural adaptation and population growth, and identify the conditions that favor learning from older vs. younger individuals. We find that, even with age structure, social learning can evolve without increasing population fitness, i.e., ``Rogers' paradox'' still holds. However, a process of ``demographic filtering'', together with cultural transmission, can generate cumulative improvements in adaptation levels. We further show that older age classes have higher proportions of adaptive behavior when the environment is stable and adaptive behavior is hard to acquire but important to survival. Through individual-based simulations comparing temporal and spatial variability in the environment, we find a ``copy-the-old''-strategy only evolves when social learning is erroneous and the opposite ``copy-the-young''-strategy can function as a compromise between individual and social information use. Our results reveal that age structure substantially changes how culture evolves and provide principled empirical expectations about age-biased social learning and the role of demography in cultural adaptation.},

Results from population genetics, however, demonstrate that in populations with complex demographic structure or mode of inheritance, it is not the census population size, N, but the effective size of a population, Ne, that determines important evolutionary parameters. Here, we examine the concept of effective population size for traits that evolve culturally, through processes of innovation and social learning. We use mathematical and computational modeling approaches to investigate how cultural Ne and levels of diversity depend on (1) the way traits are learned, (2) population connectedness, and (3) social network structure. We show that one-to-many and frequency-dependent transmission can temporally or permanently lower effective population size compared to census numbers. We caution that migration and cultural exchange can have counter-intuitive effects on Ne. Network density in random networks leaves Ne unchanged, scale-free networks tend to decrease and small-world networks tend to increase Ne compared to census numbers. For one-to-many transmission and different network structures, larger effective sizes are closely associated with higher cultural diversity. For connectedness, however, even small amounts of migration and cultural exchange result in high diversity independently of Ne. Extending previous work, our results highlight the importance of carefully defining effective population size for cultural systems and show that inferring Ne requires detailed knowledge about underlying cultural and demographic processes.},

Indeed, orientation sensitivity is greater near the cardinals, and small deviations from cardinal axes may be illusorily perceived in an exaggerated manner. Here, we quantified this illusory deviation from the cardinals at various visibility levels, by having participants reproduce the orientation of oriented Gabor stimuli whose visibility was manipulated by duration and masking. We found, first, that participants could reproduce quite accurately the orientation of very brief stimuli presented at lowest visibility levels. Second, the magnitude of the deviation followed a non-monotonic pattern, being maximal for stimuli of intermediate visibility, and lower for both the lowest and highest visibility levels. Thus, orientation processing at lowest visibility levels is noisier but paradoxically more faithful to the physical input. This counterintuitive result suggests that categorical processing of sensory information depends on perceptual awareness.},

  abstract = {What are the origins of musical rhythm? One approach to the biology and evolution of music consists in finding common musical traits across species. These similarities allow biomusicologists to infer when and how musical traits appeared in our species1. A parallel approach to the biology and evolution of music focuses on finding statistical universals in human music2. These include rhythmic features that appear above chance across musical cultures. One such universal is the production of categorical rhythms3, defined as those where temporal intervals between note onsets are distributed categorically rather than uniformly2,4,5. Prominent rhythm categories include those with intervals related by small integer ratios, such as 1:1 (isochrony) and 1:2, which translates as some notes being twice as long as their adjacent ones. In humans, universals are often defined in relation to the beat, a top-down cognitive process of inferring a temporal regularity from a complex musical scene1. Without assuming the presence of the beat in other animals, one can still investigate its downstream products, namely rhythmic categories with small integer ratios detected in recorded signals. Here we combine the comparative and statistical universals approaches, testing the hypothesis that rhythmic categories and small integer ratios should appear in species showing coordinated group singing3. We find that a lemur species displays, in its coordinated songs, the isochronous and 1:2 rhythm categories seen in human music, showing that such categories are not, among mammals, unique to humans3.},

One of the most promising aspects from a comparative point of view is the analysis of rhythmic components, which are crucial features of human communicative performance but also well-identifiable patterns in the vocal displays of other species. Therefore, the study of rhythm is becoming essential to understand the mechanisms of singing behavior and the evolution of human communication. Recent findings provided evidence that particular rhythmic structures occur in human music and some singing animal species, such as birds and rock hyraxes, but only 2 species of nonhuman primates have been investigated so far (Indri indri and Hylobates lar). Therefore, our study aims to consistently broaden the list of species studied regarding the presence of rhythmic categories. We investigated the temporal organization in the singing of 3 species of crested gibbons (Nomascus gabriellae, Nomascus leucogenys, and Nomascus siki) and found that the most prominent rhythmic category was isochrony. Moreover, we found slight variation in songs' tempo among species, with N. gabriellae and N. siki singing with a temporal pattern involving a gradually increasing tempo (a musical accelerando), and N. leucogenys with a more regular pattern. Here, we show how the prominence of a peak at the isochrony establishes itself as a shared characteristic in the small apes considered so far.},

The birds classified these novel test stimuli with high accuracy throughout, according to their symmetry or asymmetry. Their performance was not disturbed by sets of test stimuli whose geometrical style differed considerably from the training stimuli. Pigeons were even able to discriminate when only allowed the use of one eye. The generalization series were partly designed to test some classical symmetry recognition theories. None was found to be adequate. Subsidiary experiments suggested that most pigeons have a slight spontaneous preference for asymmetric patterns and that symmetry/asymmetry differences can aid pattern discrimination learning at an early stage. It is concluded that pigeons, much like humans, can discriminate bilaterally symmetric from non-symmetric visual forms in a concept-like, generalizing way. The onotgenetic and phylogenetic development of this competence is considered. A novel symmetry recognition hypothesis based on spatial frequency analysis and neuronal feature-detector considerations is proposed.},

This system allows the 19 movements of the instrument to run by using high-level software, a ``master'' board, and 19 ``slave'' boards. The Astrophysique Lineal et BIdimensional par R\'Eseaux Optiques (ALBIREO) spectrograph has three working modes and is installed in the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada, Granada, Spain. We describe a low-cost system realized for the automatization of a multifunction spectrograph. It allows the control of a large number of motors: 19 for Albireo; the theoretical limit is 32{$\mkern1mu$}768! Another advantage of this architecture based on ``slave'' boards is to supply each motor with exactly the current it needs to reach the required torque (reliability and repetitivity of motions are obtained when the motor torque is at least twice the resistant torque). Thus, we can avoid unnecessary overheating which would be detrimental to the material as well as to the local image quality (seeing). The reliability of the system is obtained by software filtering the commands and also by using optocoupled electronics to avoid interference. For a complex instrument, the high-level software must be user friendly. The efficiency of the present software in this respect has been appreciated since first being used on the telescope. This system may be of interest to laboratories and observatories with similar needs for automation of motions. The adoption of this system will be supported by the IAA Laboratory, Granada, Spain.},

  abstract = {Rhythmic stability (nonrandom temporal structure) is required for many neural and physiological functions, whereas rhythmic irregularities can indicate genetic or developmental deficiencies. Therefore, rhythmic courtship or contest signals are widespread in nature as honest advertisement displays. Examination of bird songs revealed the pervasiveness of categorical rhythmic patterns that can be described as small integer ratios between sequential inter-call intervals. As similar rhythmic profiles are prevalent in human music, it was suggested that a shared functionality could drive both animal songs and human musical rhythms, facilitating synchrony between signallers and enabling easy identification of performance errors. Here we examined whether the rhythmic structure and the rhythmic stability of vocal displays are related to reproductive success in male rock hyraxes (Procavia capensis), which presents an unusual case of a terrestrial singing mammal. We combined long-term parentage analysis of 13 male hyraxes (22 male/years) with an analysis of an audio library of 105 hyrax songs. Male annual reproductive success was determined by the number of offspring that survived to the age of 1 year. The frequency of singing events was used to determine the seasonal singing effort for each male. Songs were analysed for rhythmic structure, focusing on the presence of categorical rhythms and the contribution of rhythmic stability to annual reproductive success. We found that male hyraxes that sing more frequently tend to have more surviving offspring and that the rhythmic profile of hyrax songs is predominantly isochronous with sequential vocal element pairs nearly equally spaced. The ratio of isochronous vocal element transitions (on-integer) to element transitions that deviate from an isochronous pattern (off-integer) in hyrax songs is positively correlated with male reproductive success. Our findings support the notion that isochronous rhythmic stability can serve as an indication of quality in sexually selected signals and is not necessarily driven by the need for multiple caller synchronization. The relative scarcity of nonisochronous rhythmic categories in individually performed hyrax songs raises the question of whether such rhythmic categories could be a product of collective, coordinated signalling, while being selected against in individual performance.},

  abstract = {Studying macroevolutionary patterns of phenotypic variation and their driving forces in large radiations can shed light on how biodiversity is generated across broad spatiotemporal scales. In this study, we integrated song and morphological variation across more than 300 species representing the largest family of songbirds, the tanagers (Thraupidae), to uncover how morphological variables of the vocal tract combine to shape vocal evolution on a macroevolutionary scale. We found that body size correlated with multiple frequency parameters, concurring with past studies that show how body size constrains vocal evolution. Furthermore, bill size predicted multiple frequency and temporal song characters while bill shape was strongly associated with trill rates, suggesting that bill size and shape both constrain distinct elements of avian song independently of body size covariation. Our results demonstrate that the relationship between morphology and song exhibits modular variation when expanded to a macroevolutionary scale. Furthermore, our study emphasizes the need to consider multiple components of the avian vocal tract when exploring the macroevolutionary interplay of morphological traits and acoustic signals.\textbullet{} Avian vocalizations vary widely among birds and are associated with multiple aspects of their biology, including mechanisms of sexual selection, habitat acoustics, and avian vocal tract morphology.\textbullet{} The avian vocal tract is composed of many internal and external traits, but relatively few studies have disentangled the impact of multiple avian tract components on the evolution of bird song.\textbullet{} In this study, we quantify associations between 11 song variables and tarsus length (representing body size), bill size, and bill shape used in courtship displays of tanagers, the largest family of songbirds.\textbullet{} We find that both body size and bill morphology (size and shape) are correlated with various aspects of tanager song.\textbullet{} Taken together, different components of the avian vocal tract selectively constrain unique aspects of their vocalizations.\textbullet{} Future studies could examine internal (e.g., tracheal and syringeal) morphological traits in combination with bill morphology to gain a more comprehensive insight into how different elements of the avian vocal tract shape avian vocalizations.},

To evaluate the influence of these two selective pressures on repertoire evolution in a species with a complex repertoire, we examined repertoire structure, song sharing, reproductive success, and territory tenure in a Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis(L., 1766)) population in New Hampshire. Over two breeding seasons, we recorded 63 singing males, classified their song repertoires, quantified male song sharing, and determined male reproductive success and territory tenure. Male Canada Warblers had complex repertoires averaging 12 phrases (particular sequences of song elements) and 55 variants (songs composed of particular sequences of phrases). Song sharing decreased significantly with distance between territories, all of which were {$<$} 1.75 km apart. Network analysis revealed clusters of male neighbours with high variant sharing, which was significantly associated with longer territory tenure. Overall pairing and fledging success were high, but were not related to repertoire size or song sharing. Our results suggest that song sharing aids in male territory acquisition and defence, and that females may therefore select mates based on their ability to retain a high-quality territory.},

The wood-warblers (family Parulidae) are a diverse family of songbirds in which males of many migratory species use different song types or patterns of song delivery (known as `singing modes') depending on context. The vocal behaviour of most tropical resident warblers remains undescribed, although these species differ ecologically and behaviourally from migratory species, and may therefore differ in their vocal behaviour. We test whether male Rufous-capped Warblers Basileuterus rufifrons use distinct singing modes by examining song structure and context-dependent variation in their songs. We recorded multiple song bouts from 50 male Warblers in a Costa Rican population over 3~years to describe seasonal, diel and annual variation in song structure and vocal behaviour. We found that Rufous-capped Warbler songs are complex, with many syllable types shared both within and between males' repertoires. Males varied their song output depending on context: they sang long songs at a high rate at dawn and during the breeding season, and shortened songs in the presence of a vocalizing female mate. Unlike many migratory species, Rufous-capped Warblers do not appear to have different singing modes; they did not change the song variants used or the pattern of song delivery according to time of day, season or female vocal activity. Our research provides the first detailed vocal analysis of any Basileuterus warbler species, and enhances our understanding of the evolution of repertoire specialization in tropical resident songbirds.},

One of these, song-type switching, has been suggested to be a conventional signal in male\textendash male interactions. However, this behavior does not show a consistent pattern across species. In this study, we asked whether variation in song-switching rate carries a message for song receivers among territorial chaffinches, \emph{Fringilla coelebs}. Chaffinch song is well described, but only a few studies have focused on the communicative function of song-type switching or bout duration. Using data from playback experiments, we show here that variation in song-type switching rate affects the response of chaffinches. In response to the low switching rate treatment, territorial males began to sing later, produced fewer songs and more rain calls, decreased flight intensity, and spent more time close to the speaker than during playback of songs with a high switching rate. Our results provide strong evidence that the song-type switching rate is an agonistic signal in the chaffinch and that territorial males exhibit a stronger response toward rivals that sing with a lower song-type switching rate. A secondary purpose of our study was to determine the receivers' response with respect to their own song rate and song repertoire. We found that the reaction of tested males was correlated with their own spontaneous song rate. This implies that a male's response to stimuli may be predicted on the basis of his own song output.}

  abstract = {The finding that people of Chinese heritage tend to emphasize somatic rather than psychological symptoms of depression has frequently been discussed in the culture and mental health literature since the 1970s. Recent studies have confirmed that Chinese samples report more somatic and fewer psychological depression symptoms compared to "Western" samples. The question remains, however, as to whether or not these effects are attributable to variation in all the constituent symptoms or to a subset. If the latter, there is the additional possibility that some symptoms might show a divergent pattern. Such findings would have implications for how cultural variations in symptom presentation are interpreted, and would also inform the cultural study of affective experiences more broadly. The current study addressed these issues in Chinese (n = 175) and Euro-Canadian (n = 107) psychiatric outpatients originally described by Ryder et al. (2008). Differential item functioning (DIF) was used to examine whether specific somatic and psychological symptoms diverged from the overall patterns of cultural variation. Chi-square analyses were used to examine atypical somatic symptoms (e.g., hypersomnia), previously neglected in this literature. No DIF was observed for the typical somatic symptoms, but Euro-Canadians reported greater levels of atypical somatic symptoms, and showed higher rates of atypical depression. DIF was observed for psychological symptoms-the Chinese reported high levels of "suppressed emotions" and "depressed mood," relative to their overall psychological symptom reporting. Chinese outpatients also spontaneously reported "depressed mood" at similar levels as the Euro-Canadians, contrary to prevailing ideas about Chinese unwillingness to discuss depression. Overall, the findings provide a more nuanced picture of how culture shapes symptom presentation and point toward future studies designed to unpack cultural variation in narrower subsets of depressive symptoms.},

  abstract = {The remarkable ecological and demographic success of humanity is largely attributed to our capacity for cumulative culture. The accumulation of beneficial cultural innovations across generations is puzzling because transmission events are generally imperfect, although there is large variance in fidelity. Events of perfect cultural transmission and innovations should be more frequent in a large population. As a consequence, a large population size may be a prerequisite for the evolution of cultural complexity, although anthropological studies have produced mixed results and empirical evidence is lacking. Here we use a dual-task computer game to show that cultural evolution strongly depends on population size, as players in larger groups maintained higher cultural complexity. We found that when group size increases, cultural knowledge is less deteriorated, improvements to existing cultural traits are more frequent, and cultural trait diversity is maintained more often. Our results demonstrate how changes in group size can generate both adaptive cultural evolution and maladaptive losses of culturally acquired skills. As humans live in habitats for which they are ill-suited without specific cultural adaptations, it suggests that, in our evolutionary past, group-size reduction may have exposed human societies to significant risks, including societal collapse. \textcopyright{} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Instead, they result from a cumulative process in which innovations are gradually added to existing cultural traits across many generations. Recent work suggests that a population's ability to develop complex technologies is positively affected by its size and connectedness. Here, we present a simple computer-based experiment that compares the accumulation of innovations by fully and partially connected groups of the same size in a complex fitness landscape. We find that the propensity to learn from successful individuals drastically reduces cultural diversity within fully connected groups. In comparison, partially connected groups produce more diverse solutions, and this diversity allows them to develop complex solutions that are never produced in fully connected groups.

  abstract = {Identifying the determinants of cumulative cultural evolution is a key issue in the interdisciplinary field of cultural evolution. A widely held view is that large and well-connected social networks facilitate cumulative cultural evolution because they promote the spread of useful cultural traits and prevent the loss of cultural knowledge through factors such as drift. This view stems from models that focus on the transmission of cultural information, without considering how new cultural traits actually arise. In this paper, we review the literature from various fields that suggest that, under some circumstances, increased connectedness can decrease cultural diversity and reduce innovation rates. Incorporating this idea into an agent-based model, we explore the effect of population fragmentation on cumulative culture and show that, for a given population size, there exists an intermediate level of population fragmentation that maximizes the rate of cumulative cultural evolution. This result is explained by the fact that fully connected, non-fragmented populations are able to maintain complex cultural traits but produce insufficient variation and so lack the cultural diversity required to produce highly complex cultural traits. Conversely, highly fragmented populations produce a variety of cultural traits but cannot maintain complex ones. In populations with intermediate levels of fragmentation, cultural loss and cultural diversity are balanced in a way that maximizes cultural complexity. Our results suggest that population structure needs to be taken into account when investigating the relationship between demography and cumulative culture.

Although many studies have focused on the direct influence of ecological and sexual selection on signal divergence, the role of indirect mechanisms remains poorly understood. Using phenotypic and molecular datasets, we explored the interplay between morphological and vocal evolution in an avian radiation characterized by dramatic beak variation, the Neotropical woodcreepers (Dendrocolaptinae). We found evidence of a trade-off between the rate of repetition of song syllables and frequency bandwidth: slow paced songs had either narrow or wide frequency bandwidths, and bandwidth decreased as song pace increased. This bounded phenotypic space for song structure supports the hypothesis that passerine birds face a motor constraint during song production. Diversification of acoustic characters within this bounded space was correlated with diversification of beak morphology. In particular, species with larger beaks produced slower songs with narrower frequency bandwidths, suggesting that ecological selection on beak morphology influences the diversification of woodcreeper songs. Because songs in turn mediate mate choice and species recognition in birds, these results indicate a broader role for ecology in avian diversification. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author(s).

Sensory drive and magic traits both contribute to variation in signal structure, yet we have limited understanding of the relative role of these direct and indirect processes during signal evolution. Using phylogenetic analyses across 276 species of ov-enbirds (Aves: Furnariidae), we compared the extent to which song evolution was related to the direct influence of habitat characteristics and the indirect effect of body size and beak size, two potential magic traits in birds. We find that indirect ecological selection, via diversification in putative magic traits, explains variation in temporal, spectral, and performance features of song. Body size influences song frequency, whereas beak size limits temporal and performance components of song. In comparison , direct ecological selection has weaker and more limited effects on song structure.

To attain this rigor and nuance, we propose a five-step formal approach for solving methodological problems. To illustrate the use and benefits of such formalism, we present a formal statistical analysis of three popular claims in the metascientific literature: (i) that reproducibility is the cornerstone of science; (ii) that data must not be used twice in any analysis; and (iii) that exploratory projects imply poor statistical practice. We show how our formal approach can inform and shape debates about such methodological claims.},

  abstract = {The classic view of brain sexual differentiation and behavior is that gonadal steroid hormones act directly to promote sex differences in neural and behavioral development. In particular, the actions of testosterone and its metabolites induce a masculine pattern of brain development, while inhibiting feminine neural and behavioral patterns of differentiation. However, recent evidence indicates that gonadal hormones may not solely be responsible for sex differences in brain development and behavior between males and females. Here we examine an alternative hypothesis that genes, by directly inducing sexually dimorphic patterns of neural development, can influence the sexual differences between male and female brains. Using microarrays and RT-PCR, we have detected over 50 candidate genes for differential sex expression, and confirmed at least seven murine genes which show differential expression between the developing brains of male and female mice at stage 10.5 days post coitum (dpc), before any gonadal hormone influence. The identification of genes differentially expressed between male and female brains prior to gonadal formation suggests that genetic factors may have roles in influencing brain sexual differentiation. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Network motifs are often called the building blocks of networks. Analysis of motifs has been found to be an indispensable tool for understanding local network structure, in contrast to measures based on node degree distribution and its functions that primarily address a global network topology. As a result, networks that are similar in terms of global topological properties may differ noticeably at a local level. This phenomenon of the impact of local structure has been recently documented in network fragility analysis and classification. At the same time, many studies of networks still tend to focus on global topological measures, often failing to unveil hidden mechanisms behind vulnerability of real networks and their dynamic response to malfunctions. In this paper, a study of motif-based analysis of network resilience and reliability under various types of intentional attacks is presented, with the goal of shedding light on local dynamics and vulnerability of networks. These methods are demonstrated on electricity transmission networks of 4 European countries, and the results are compared with commonly used resilience and reliability measures.}

"The fourth edition of 'Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities' critically examines the breadth of research on this complex and controversial topic, with the principal aim of helping the reader to understand where sex differences are found--and where they are not. Since the publication of the third edition, there have been many exciting and illuminating developments in our understanding of cognitive sex differences. Modern neuroscience has transformed our understanding of the mind and behavior in general, but particularly the way we think about cognitive sex differences. But neuroscience is still in its infancy and has often been misused to justify sex role stereotypes. There has also been the publication of many exaggerated and unreplicated claims regarding cognitive sex differences. Consequently, throughout the book there is recognition of the critical importance of good research; an amiable skepticism of the nature and strength of evidence behind any claim of sex difference; an appreciation of the complexity of the questions about cognitive sex differences; and the ability to see multiple sides of an issues, while also realizing that some claims are well-reasoned and supported by data and others are politicized pseudoscience. The author endeavors to present and interpret all the relevant data fairly, and in the process reveals how there are strong data for many different views. The book explores sex differences from many angles and in many settings, including the effect of different abilities and levels of education on sex differences, pre-existing beliefs or stereotypes, culture, and hormones. Sex differences in the brain are explored along with the stern caveat to "mind the gap" between brain structures and behaviors. Readers should come away with a new understanding of the way nature and nurture work together to make us unique individuals while also creating similarities and differences that are often (but not always) tied to our being female and male. 'Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities, Fourth Edition, ' can be used as a textbook or reference in a range of courses and will inspire the next generation of researchers. Halpern engages readers in the big societal questions that are inherent in the controversial topic of whether, when, and how much males and females differ psychologically. It should be required reading for parents, teachers, and policy makers who want to know about the ways in which males and females are different and similar."--Publisher's website.

  abstract = {Song dialects, as a special case of geographical variation in vocalization, are useful tools in the study of a number of topics ranging from cultural evolution to the emergence of reproductive barriers, and thus continue to be the focus of many bird-song studies. The Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella is a common Palaearctic bird with a long breeding season and song period, whose distinctive song exhibits clearly distinguishable dialects differing in the composition of the final phrase. The species is therefore particularly suitable for large-scale studies of dialect distribution involving not only experts but also members of the public. Here we demonstrate that citizen science can indeed allow mapping of songbird dialect distribution on a national scale in unprecedented detail. During the project Dialects of Czech Yellowhammers, which collected almost 4000 recordings over 6~years (2011\textendash 2016), we obtained information on dialect distribution for almost 90\% of the territory of Czechia. We detected most of the common dialect types known elsewhere in Europe, and these were distributed in a fragmented fashion, with several unusual and rare dialects also detected in small areas. However, the highly scattered distribution of birds using some final phrases traditionally assigned to distinct dialects suggests that classification of Yellowhammer dialects warrants a thorough re-assessment based on quantitative data. Successful involvement of the public in this and other ongoing citizen science projects has contributed to the establishment of the Yellowhammer as a model species for dialect research. The dataset will serve as a foundation for future studies investigating processes responsible for the origin and maintenance of avian dialects, and may be particularly useful for evaluating their spatial and temporal stability.},

  abstract = {Human\textendash wildlife conflict is one of the most critical threats facing many wildlife species today, and the topic is receiving increasing attention from conservation biologists. Direct wildlife damage is commonly cited as the main driver of conflict, and many tools exist for reducing such damage. However, significant conflict often remains even after damage has been reduced, suggesting that conflict requires novel, comprehensive approaches for long-term resolution. Although most mitigation studies investigate only the technical aspects of conflict reduction, peoples' attitudes towards wildlife are complex, with social factors as diverse as religious affiliation, ethnicity and cultural beliefs all shaping conflict intensity. Moreover, human\textendash wildlife conflicts are often manifestations of underlying human\textendash human conflicts, such as between authorities and local people, or between people of different cultural backgrounds. Despite evidence that social factors can be more important in driving conflict than wildlife damage incurred, they are often ignored in conflict studies. Developing a broader awareness of conflict drivers will advance understanding of the patterns and underlying processes behind this critical conservation issue. In this paper, I review a wide variety of case studies to show how social factors strongly influence perceptions of human\textendash wildlife conflict, and highlight how mitigation approaches should become increasingly innovative and interdisciplinary in order to enable people to move from conflict towards coexistence.},

We hypothesized that cultural evolution of song depends on both experience-independent biases and tutor songs available. We predicted that songs more distant from wild-type would take longer to culturally evolve toward wild-type features. We bred zebra finches in three groups of lineages in which offspring of each generation served as tutors for the next. Lineages were founded with males singing wild-type song, isolate song, or heterospecific song. The two experimental lineages exhibited rapid cultural evolution of song with many temporal and spectral features converging to wild-type within two generations. However the rate of change differed depending on song features measured, and took longer for lineages founded with heterospecific song.},

The distinction between signal and noise plays an important part in explaining how different methods are suitable for exploring different aspects of the data, rather than being viewed as competing methods with the same general objectives. Explanations are largely set in a geometrical context, thus keeping technical mathematics to a minimum; a common Analysis of Variance framework allows all the methods to be considered in a unified way and suggests some new ways in which these kinds of data may be analysed.

We investigated whether natal dispersal correlated with a predisposed behavioural trait: exploratory behaviour in novel environments. Wild great tits were caught in their natural habitat, tested the following morning in the laboratory using an open field test and released at the capture site. Natal dispersal correlated positively with parental and individual exploratory behaviour, using three independent datasets. First, fast\textendash exploring parents had offspring that dispersed furthest. Second, immigrants were faster explorers than locally born birds. Third, post\textendash fledging movements, comprising a major proportion of the variation in natal dispersal distances, were greater for fast females than for slow females. These findings suggest that parental behaviour influenced offspring natal dispersal either via parental behaviour per se (e.g. via post\textendash fledging care) or by affecting the phenotype of their offspring (e.g. via their genes). Because this personality trait has a genetic basis, our results imply that genotypes differ in their dispersal distances. Therefore, the described patterns have profound consequences for the genetic composition of populations.},

However, males with high song output exhibited greater variability in vocal performance, suggesting that some individuals might experience fatigue in song production. Furthermore, birds that had been developmentally stressed as juveniles showed greater improvement over the morning than birds that were not stressed. If conspecifics attend to within-individual variation in vocal performance, then improvement in vocal performance over the course of a day may drive birds to sing early and often, although fatigue may limit the extent to which this advantage may be gained.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

For illustrative purposes, we studied spatial genetic divergence among 25 populations of Dipteryx alata ("Baru"), a tree species endemic to the Cerrado, the Brazilian savannas, based on 8 microsatellite loci. We also applied alternative methods to analyze spatial patterns in this dataset, especially a multivariate generalization of Spatial Eigenfunction Analysis based on redundancy analysis. The different approaches resulted in similar estimates of the magnitude of spatial structure in the genetic data. Furthermore, the results were expected based on previous knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary processes underlying genetic variation in this species. Our review shows that a careful application and interpretation of Mantel tests, especially Mantel correlograms, can overcome some potential statistical problems and provide a simple and useful tool for multivariate analysis of spatial patterns of genetic divergence.},

As there are several factors that influence the prevalence of PMS, the present study was done to investigate the worldwide prevalence of PMS using meta-analysis method. Methods: In a meta-analysis with random-effects model, the ISI, Pubmed and Scopus databases were searched and 53 articles from 1996-2011were extracted. After reviewing the articles based on inclusion criteria, 17 studies were selected. Results of these studies were evaluated with a random-effects model meta-analysis. Variance of each study was obtained using binomial distribution. Heterogeneity of study was checked using I2 index. Results: In total of 17 papers, 18803 people entered into the meta analysis and the pooled prevalence of PMS was obtained 48. Pooled prevalence of PMS was reported 40 in Europe, 85 in Africa, 46 in Asia and 60 in South America. Meta-regression scatter plot revealed that with increasing the sample size, the prevalence of PMS decreased. The difference was statistically significant (p=0.013). However, the correlation between prevalence of PMS and year of study was not significant (p=0.797). Conclusion: Studies carried out in different parts of the world have examined the prevalence of PMS using different tools. Considering that the highest prevalence of premenstrual syndrome has been reported in Iran, measure of the disorder in different age, social and cultural groups using appropriate assessment tools is recommended.},

Since autosomes are present in two copies in diploid organisms the heterogametic sex has become a natural ``aneuploid'' with haploinsufficiency for X- or Z-linked genes. Specific mechanisms have evolved to restore a balance between critical gene products throughout the genome and between males and females. Some of these mechanisms were co-opted from and/or added to compensatory processes that alleviate autosomal aneuploidy. Surprisingly, several modes of dosage compensation have evolved.

The mean number of nests produced per female, including those destroyed by predators, was 2.97. Clutch size ranged from 2 to 5. The mean clutch size based on 1,142 eggs in 284 nests of known clutch size was 4.02. Not only was the four-egg clutch most numerous but a greater percentage of eggs in the four-egg clutches hatched and the mean number of young fledged per nest was also highest. The mean incubation period was 12.2 days, the mean duration of nestling life was 9 days, and the approximate length of the breeding season as 52 days. The daily mortality rate of eggs was 11.9\% and of nestlings 2.1\%. Predation was the major factor affecting reproductive success; 50.5\% of all nests located were destroyed by predators. The main nest predators were Common Crows and Herring Gulls. Of the nests destroyed by predators, 87.8\% contained eggs rather than nestlings. The intense predation necessitated high nest replacement. The mean interval between the termination of one nest and the appearance of the first egg in the succeeding nest was 6.3 days. If successive nests are destroyed on the day incubation begins, it is hypothetically possible for a pair to produce four nests during a single breeding season; many birds in the population produce at least three. Although enough time was available for birds to fledge two broods in a season, few of them fledged more than one. Thus, the nesting success was low (success from egg to hatching 18.1\%). High nest replacement compensated for high egg mortality, and an average of 2.16 young per pair were fledged per season.},

It considers perception of real motion in point-light experiments and the perception of motion in stills via the work of various psychologists, in the course of which it raises theoretical questions about the nature of visual perception. It then offers a detailed examination of knowledge regarding neural substrates for both real and depicted motion perception. Finally, it combines psychological and neurophysiological perspectives with phenomenologically-oriented observation of pictures, discussing both frontoparallel motion and motion in depth (in particular the phenomenon of "looming") in terms of two kinds of depictions, the "narrative" and the "performative". Examples are drawn from all kinds of pictures, but focus is on world rock art, whose time depth is especially amenable to the universalist approach adopted by the paper.},

After conversion to cents, a logarithmic unit, each bird's song data were averaged and placed into three distributions: largest interval in whole song, largest interval between adjacent notes in each song, and all intervals between adjacent frequency peaks in each song. These three distributions plus another from African shrike data previously published by Thorpe did not significantly correlate with a distribution derived from commonly used Western musical scales. It is therefore suggested that utilization of Western musical notation may lead one to overemphasize the ''musical'' quality of bird song.},

In spite of this long period and many published papers, our current state of knowledge reviewed here only allows us to conclude that patterns are heterogeneous and that very little is known about the underlying causes of this heterogeneity. In addition, the statistical properties of FA as a measure of DI are only poorly grasped because of a general lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive DI. If we want to avoid that this area of research becomes abandoned, more efforts should be made to understand the observed heterogeneity, and attempts should be made to develop a unifying statistical protocol. More specifically, and perhaps most importantly, it is argued here that more attention should be paid to the usefulness of FA as a measure of DI since many factors might blur this relationship. Furthermore, the genetic architecture, associations with fitness and the importance of compensatory growth should be investigated under a variety of stress situations. In addition, more focus should be directed to the underlying mechanisms of DI as well as how these processes map to the observable phenotype. These insights could yield more efficient statistical models and a unified approach to the analysis of patterns in FA and DI. The study of both DI and canalization is indispensable to obtain better insights in their possible common origin, especially because both have been suggested to play a role in both micro- and macro-evolutionary processes.},

While a considerable amount is known about hearing and vocal communication in birds, how exactly birds perceive their auditory world still remains somewhat of a mystery. For sure, field and laboratory studies suggest that birds hear the spectral, gross temporal features (i.e. envelope) and perhaps syntax of birdsong much like we do. However, there is also ample anecdotal evidence that birds are consistently more sensitive than humans to at least some aspects of their song. Here we review several psychophysical studies supporting Marler's intuitions that birds have both an exquisite sensitivity to temporal fine structure and may be able to focus their auditory attention on critical acoustic details of their vocalizations. Zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, particularly, seem to be extremely sensitive to temporal fine structure in both synthetic stimuli and natural vocalizations. This finding, together with recent research highlighting the complexity of zebra finch vocalizations across contexts, raises interesting questions about what information zebra finches may be communicating in temporal fine structure. Together these findings show there is an acoustic richness in bird vocalizations that is available to birds but likely out of reach for human listeners. Depending on the universality of these findings, it raises questions about how we approach the study of birdsong and whether potentially significant information is routinely being encoded in the temporal fine structure of avian vocal signals.},

Scientists have long debated the extent to which principles of scale generation in human music are biologically or culturally determined. Data from animal "song" may provide new insights into this discussion. Here, by examining pitch relationships using both a simple linear regression model and a Bayesian generative model, we show that most songs of the hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus) favor simple frequency ratios derived from the harmonic (or overtone) series. Furthermore, we show that this frequency selection results not from physical constraints governing peripheral production mechanisms but from active selection at a central level. These data provide the most rigorous empirical evidence to date of a bird song that makes use of the same mathematical principles that underlie Western and many non-Western musical scales, demonstrating surprising convergence between human and animal "song cultures." Although there is no evidence that the songs of most bird species follow the overtone series, our findings add to a small but growing body of research showing that a preference for small-integer frequency ratios is not unique to humans. These findings thus have important implications for current debates about the origins of human musical systems and may call for a reevaluation of existing theories of musical consonance based on specific human vocal characteristics.},

  abstract = {The extended evolutionary synthesis (EES) intends to offer~a new framework for understanding evolution based mainly on empirical and theoretical findings of current studies, including heredity and evolutionary developmental biology. In this essay, we present and develop the following objections about the terminology associated with the EES literature: (1) despite using the term "extension," EES protagonists claim new evolutionary processes, reformulate conceptual networks, and modify central assumptions of the evolutionary synthesis (ES). Therefore, the difference between ES and EES should not be described in terms of a set-subset relationship (that is, as an extension); (2) despite using the term "synthesis," the~EES leads, at least in the short term, to a pluralism of approaches in evolutionary biology. Thus, we argue that the~EES should not be described as a synthesis, but as a broad and plural interpretative framework encompassing different approaches. These objections are not directed to the proposed changes, but to the interpretation of these changes as a mere expansion of the previous evolutionary framework, as well as to the interpretation of the EES as a synthesis. Based on these objections, we seek to present some explanations for the use of the term "extended synthesis" among its protagonists.}

We tested the hypothesis that blue tit trilled song represents a character shift that evolved because it reduced territorial interactions with more dominant great tits. We conducted five sets of playback trials in three study populations (mainland southern France, Corsica and Denmark) presenting male great tits with blue tit trilled and untrilled songs and great tit songs. We found that great tits respond equally strongly to both blue tit untrilled songs and to great tit songs, but show a significantly weaker response to blue tit trilled songs. These findings are the first experimental evidence that interspecific competition may play an important role in macrogeographic variation of bird song.},

We studied this relationship in three populations presenting differences in density, quantity of food available and relative and absolute densities of Great Tits Parus major. Great Tit density may be an important factor because this species is supposed to be in competition for acoustic space with the Blue Tit. We found a positive correlation between Blue Tit dawn repertoire size and tarsus length in the three study populations which is consistent with the tested hypothesis. However, this correlation was only significant in the population with the lower Great Tit density. We discuss the significance of this variation and propose that interspecific competition may limit the action of sexual selection on song repertoire size.},

In order to determine the environmental factors influencing geographic variation in the proportion of blue tit songs with a trill, we conducted a comparative study. At macrogeographic and regional scales we examined the effect of three factors that could influence geographic variation in blue tit song: dominant vegetation type, intraspecific competition and interspecific competition with great tits (Parus major). Interspecific competition may result in song convergence or song divergence (hereafter called character shift). The results we obtained are consistent with predictions of the character shift hypothesis: the proportion of songs presenting a different syntax to great tit songs (songs with a trill) increases significantly with relative great tit density. Results do not support predictions of hypotheses concerning song convergence or intraspecific competition.

This cyclic defense paradigm accords with the literature on cyclic exacerbations of persistent infectious diseases and chronic diseases of uncertain cause. Similar exacerbations attributable to hormonal contraception implicate hormonal alterations as a cause of these changes. The precise timing of these cyclic exacerbations depends on the mechanisms of pathogenesis and immunological control of particular infectious agents. Insight into these mechanisms can be obtained by a comparison of timing of menstrual exacerbations with the timing of exacerbations associated with pregnancy.},

Vessel noise has the potential to interfere with the complex vocal behavior of these humpback whales which could have direct consequences on their feeding behavior and thus ultimately on their health and reproduction. Humpback whale feeding calls recorded during conditions of high vessel-generated noise and lower levels of background noise are compared for differences in acoustic structure, use, and organization using information theoretic measures. We apply information theory in a self-referential manner (i.e., orders of entropy) to quantify the changes in signaling behavior. We then compare this with the reduction in channel capacity due to noise in Glacier Bay itself treating it as a (Gaussian) noisy channel. We find that high vessel noise is associated with an increase in the rate and repetitiveness of sequential use of feeding call types in our averaged sample of humpback whale vocalizations, indicating that vessel noise may be modifying the patterns of use of feeding calls by the endangered humpback whales in Southeast Alaska. The information theoretic approach suggested herein can make a reliable quantitative measure of such relationships and may also be adapted for wider application to many species where environmental noise is thought to be a problem.},

There is a reliable interaction between candidate genes for depression and childhood adversity in relation to mental health outcomes. The aim of this paper is to explore the role of culture in this process in an urban community in Brazil. The specific cultural factor examined is cultural consonance, or the degree to which individuals are able to successfully incorporate salient cultural models into their own beliefs and behaviors. It was hypothesized that cultural consonance in family life would mediate the interaction of genotype and childhood adversity. In a study of 402 adult Brazilians from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, conducted from 2011 to 2014, the interaction of reported childhood adversity and a polymorphism in the 2A serotonin receptor was associated with higher depressive symptoms. Further analysis showed that the gene-environment interaction was mediated by cultural consonance in family life, and that these effects were more pronounced in lower social class neighborhoods. The findings reinforce the role of the serotonergic system in the regulation of stress response and learning and memory, and how these processes in turn interact with environmental events and circumstances. Furthermore, these results suggest that gene-environment interaction models should incorporate a wider range of environmental experience and more complex pathways to better understand how genes and the environment combine to influence mental health outcomes.},

Indeed, our sense of time depends on intrinsic context, such as the emotional state, and on extrinsic context, such as the rhythm of others' activity. Existing studies on the relationships between emotion and time suggest that these contextual variations in subjective time do not result from the incorrect functioning of the internal clock but rather from the excellent ability of the internal clock to adapt to events in one's environment. Finally, the fact that we live and move in time and that everything, every act, takes more or less time has often been neglected. Thus, there is no unique, homogeneous time but instead multiple experiences of time. Our subjective temporal distortions directly reflect the way our b rain and body adapt to these multiple time scales. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Royal Society.},

In the present study, the participants were presented with films inducing a specific mood and were subsequently given a temporal bisection task. More precisely, the participants were given two temporal bisection tasks, one before and the other after viewing the emotional film. Three emotional films were tested: one eliciting fear, another sadness, and a neutral control film. In addition, the direct mood experience was assessed using the Brief Mood Introspective Scale that was administered to the participants at the beginning and the end of the session. The results showed that the perception of time did not change after viewing either the neutral control films or the sad films although the participants reported being sadder and less aroused after than before watching the sad film clips. In contrast, the stimulus durations were judged longer after than before viewing the frightening films that were judged to increase the emotion of fear and arousal level. In combination with findings from previous studies, our data suggest that the selective lengthening effect after watching frightening films was mediated by an effect of arousal on the speed of the internal clock system.},

  abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of ``relaxed phylogenetics.'' Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.},

  abstract = {Costly interactions between species that arise as a by-product of ancestral similarities in communication signals are expected to persist only under specific evolutionary circumstances. Territorial aggression between species, for instance, is widely assumed to persist only when extrinsic barriers prevent niche divergence or selection in sympatry is too weak to overcome gene flow from allopatry. However, recent theoretical and comparative studies have challenged this view. Here we present a large-scale, phylogenetic analysis of the distribution and determinants of interspecific territoriality. We find that interspecific territoriality is widespread in birds and strongly associated with hybridization and resource overlap during the breeding season. Contrary to the view that territoriality only persists between species that rarely breed in the same areas or where niche divergence is constrained by habitat structure, we find that interspecific territoriality is positively associated with breeding habitat overlap and unrelated to habitat structure. Furthermore, our results provide compelling evidence that ancestral similarities in territorial signals are maintained and reinforced by selection when interspecific territoriality is adaptive. The territorial signals linked to interspecific territoriality in birds depend on the evolutionary age of interacting species, plumage at shallow (within-family) timescales, and song at deeper (between-family) timescales. Evidently, territorial interactions between species have persisted and shaped phenotypic diversity on a macroevolutionary timescale.}

A standard paradigm to test if and/or how animals use and transfer social information is through social diffusion experiments, by which researchers observe how information spreads within a group, sometimes by seeding new behavior in the population. In this article, we review the context, methodology and products of such social diffusion experiments. Our major focus is the transmission of information from an individual (or group thereof) to another, and the factors that can enhance or, more interestingly, inhibit it. We therefore also discuss reasons why social transmission sometimes does not occur despite being expected to. We span a full range of mechanisms and processes, from the nature of social information itself and the cognitive abilities of various species, to the idea of social competency and the constraints imposed by the social networks in which animals are embedded. We ultimately aim at a broad reflection on practical and theoretical issues arising when studying how social information spreads within animal groups.},

For numerous marine bird species, only recent or sparse monitoring data are available, lacking the appropriate temporal perspective needed to consider natural, long-term population dynamics when developing conservation strategies. Here, we use a combination of established palaeoenvironmental approaches to examine the centennial-scale dynamics of the world's largest colony (representing approx. 50\% of the global population) of the declining and vulnerable Leach's Storm-petrel (\emph{Hydrobates leucorhous}). By reconstructing the last approximately 1700 years of the colony's population trends, we corroborate recent surveys indicating rapid declines since the 1980s. More surprisingly, however, was that the colony size was smaller and has changed strikingly in the past, even prior to the introduction of human stressors. Our results challenge notions that very large colonies are generally stable in the absence of anthropogenic pressures and speak to an increasingly pressing need to better understand inter-colony movement and recruitment when inferring range- and species-wide trends. While the recently documented decline in storm-petrels clearly warrants conservation concern, we show that colony size was consistently much lower in the past and changed markedly in the absence of major anthropogenic activity. In response, we emphasize the need for enlarged protected area networks to maintain natural population cycles, coupled with continued research to identify the driver(s) of the current global seabird decline.}

Complete responses to the questions on orgasmic dysfunction were obtained from 4037 women consisting of 683 monozygotic and 714 dizygotic pairs of female twins aged between 19 and 83 years. One in three women (32\%) reported never or infrequently achieving orgasm during intercourse, with a corresponding figure of 21\% during masturbation. A significant genetic influence was seen with an estimated heritability for difficulty reaching orgasm during intercourse of 34\% (95\% confidence interval 27-40\%) and 45\% (95\% confidence interval 38-52\%) for orgasm during masturbation. These results show that the wide variation in orgasmic dysfunction in females has a genetic basis and cannot be attributed solely to cultural influences.

These are long-standing questions that have proven difficult to answer. To test between competing hypotheses, we constructed a massive repository of historical and archaeological information known as "Seshat: Global History Databank." We systematically coded data on 414 societies from 30 regions around the world spanning the last 10,000 years. We were able to capture information on 51 variables reflecting nine characteristics of human societies, such as social scale, economy, features of governance, and information systems. Our analyses revealed that these different characteristics show strong relationships with each other and that a single principal component captures around three-quarters of the observed variation. Furthermore, we found that different characteristics of social complexity are highly predictable across different world regions. These results suggest that key aspects of social organization are functionally related and do indeed coevolve in predictable ways. Our findings highlight the power of the sciences and humanities working together to rigorously test hypotheses about general rules that may have shaped human history.},

Such an approach may be especially useful in psychiatry, which frequently addresses conditions with heterogeneous presentation and unknown causes. We review several previous applications of evolutionary theory that highlight the ways in which psychiatric conditions may persist despite and because of natural selection. One lesson from the evolutionary approach is that some conditions currently classified as disorders (because they cause distress and impairment) may actually be caused by functioning adaptations operating ``nor- mally'' (as designed by natural selection). Such conditions suggest an alternative illness model that may generate alternative intervention strategies. Thus, the evolutionary approach suggests that psychiatry should sometimes think differently about distress and impairment. The complexity of the human brain, including normal functioning and potential for dysfunctions, has developed over evolutionary time and has been shaped by natural selection. Understanding the evolutionary origins of psychiatric conditions is therefore a crucial component to a complete understanding of etiology.},

Both the intensity of this antipredator strategy and its success are positively related to the size of the group that carries out this mobbing. To recruit individuals to the mob, members of prey species produce mobbing calls. In some songbirds\textemdash the Japanese tit, \emph{Parus minor}, and the southern pied babbler, \emph{Turdoides bicolor}\textemdash mobbing calls are structurally complex and it has been suggested that they convey information by means of compositional syntax, when meaningful items are combined into larger units. These two species combine alert and recruitment calls into an alert and recruitment sequence when attracting conspecifics to cooperate in mobbing a predator. Whether this rudimentary, two-call, compositional structure is used by other bird species in mobbing calls and how it can alter the ability of heterospecifics to adequately recognize mobbing calls is not well understood. Heterospecifics' responses to mobs are critical to the success of the mobbing strategy, so it is of great importance to understand whether and how syntax influences these responses. To address these questions, we conducted two playback experiments. Firstly, we investigated whether the great tit, \emph{Parus major}, extracts different meanings from different individual motifs (i.e., component calls), and from combined motifs in both natural and artificially reversed order. We found that great tits extract different meanings from the two motifs involved in mobbing calls and that they also discriminate for motif order reversal in the mobbing call sequence. Secondly, we investigated whether heterospecifics (the coal tit, \emph{Periparus ater}, and the common chaffinch, \emph{Fringilla coelebs}) are sensitive to syntax alteration of great tit mobbing calls. While chaffinches did not respond to great tit mobbing calls, coal tits were sensitive to mobbing call sequence reversal although they did not react in the same way as conspecific subjects. Overall, whereas our results indicate that tits are sensitive to call reversal, this is not to say that tits actually use compositional syntax to increase the information content.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

In the present study, we compared the acoustic similarity of the hissing sound produced by female blue tits, a cavity-nesting species, to the hisses of three snake species. Then, we exposed mice, a model of a possible cavity competitor, to bird and snake hisses. We showed that snake and blue tit hisses are acoustically similar and provoke comparable anxiety behaviors in mice. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that blue tits utilize an innate fear response to hisses in mammals, a result that may explain why blue tit hisses have been linked to increased survival by other authors.

  doi = {10.1007/s00265-020-2820-7},
  abstract = {Many species of birds produce distinct calls when mobbing predators. These calls often recruit nearby conspecifics and heterospecifics to help drive the predators away. In some species, such as members of the family Paridae, mobbing calls are composed of multiple elements that seem to follow a characteristic order. Previous work in parids demonstrated that note ordering influences both the responses of conspecifics and some other co-occurring Paridae species. Cross-species sensitivity to note ordering could result from individuals' learning to associate individual heterospecific calls with threats or, rather, because the typical note orderings are shared across species. Here, we test these hypotheses by assessing the responses of European great tits (\emph{Parus major}) to the naturally and artificially ordered calls of black-capped chickadees (\emph{Poecile atricapillus}), a North American species. In response to the naturally ordered mobbing calls of chickadees, we found that great tits exhibit vigilance and rapidly approach the sound source, behaviors that were indistinguishable to those expressed in response to conspecific calls. If learned associations are necessary for sensitivity to note ordering, then a key prediction is that great tit responses to naturally ordered and artificially reversed chickadee calls should be similar (and weak). In contrast to this prediction, we found that great tits were less vigilant, but approach the sound source in response to artificially reversed chickadee calls. These findings suggest that perception of note ordering patterns is conserved. However, they are also in agreement with a "perception bias" hypothesis: that the first notes of the call mask the notes that follow them, preventing the receiver from perceiving the second part of the call. Although we provide evidence against perception bias, further research is needed to convincingly disentangle these two hypotheses.}

It is therefore essential for conservation practitioners, carnivore managing authorities, or livestock owners to know the effectiveness of interventions intended to reduce livestock predation by large carnivores. We reviewed the scientific literature (1990\textendash 2016), searching for evidence of the effectiveness of interventions. We found experimental and quasi-experimental studies were rare within the field, and only 21 studies applied a case-control study design (3.7\% of reviewed publications). We used a relative risk ratio to evaluate the studied interventions: changing livestock type, keeping livestock in enclosures, guarding or livestock guarding dogs, predator removal, using shock collars on carnivores, sterilizing carnivores, and using visual or auditory deterrents to frighten carnivores. Although there was a general lack of scientific evidence of the effectiveness of any of these interventions, some interventions reduced the risk of depredation whereas other interventions did not result in reduced depredation. We urge managers and stakeholders to move towards an evidence-based large carnivore management practice and researchers to conduct studies of intervention effectiveness with a randomized case-control design combined with systematic reviewing to evaluate the evidence.},

  abstract = {The importance of bird song in sexual selection and the widespread existence of geographical variation in song has raised the question of whether dialects can promote the evolution of new, reproductively isolated, subgroups. However, the effect of song learning on the relation between song divergence and gene flow is still poorly understood. We explored the origin and maintenance of song divergence and its consequences for male dispersal between populations. To do this, we used a spatially explicit model to study the effect of vocal learning mode (predispersal and postdispersal) and the role of intrasexual selection among males. The majority of scenarios simulated in the model led to significant genetic and phenotypic song divergence, consistent with the widespread occurrence of dialects in natural populations. Intrasexual selection in the form of male exclusion, dependent on song matching between neighbours, was an efficient mechanism driving song divergence. Most importantly, song learning was decisive in causing an incongruence of genetic divergence and song divergence between populations. As a consequence, song learning often prevented the expected negative relation between the degree of song divergence and dispersal. These findings may help to interpret empirical data on song divergence and gene flow and provide qualitative and testable predictions for conditions under which intraspecific song variation may promote reproductive divergence and speciation.

An important avenue for analyzing creativity is by means of spontaneous improvisation, although there are major challenges to characterizing the products of improvisation because of their variable nature. A useful concept missing from the analysis of improvisation is the idea that the products of a corpus can be organized into a series of ``style-types,'' where each type differs from others in certain key structural features. Clustering methods provide a reliable quantitative means of examining the organization of style-types within a diverse corpus of improvisations. To look at the utility of such methods, we examined a sample of 72 vocal melodic improvisations produced by novice improvisers. We first classified the melodies acous- tically using a multidimensional musical-classification scheme, which coded the melodies for 19 distinct features of musical structure. We next employed multiple correspondence analysis (a dimensional reduction method) and k-means cluster analysis simultaneously, and obtained 3 relatively discrete clusters of improvisations. Stylistic analysis of these clusters revealed that they differed in key musical features related to phrase structure and rhythm. Cluster analyses provide a promising means of describing and analyzing the products of creativity, including variable structures like spontaneous improvisations.},

The other was sire choice hypothesis, which posits that women's orgasm behavior signals increased chances of fertilization. To test the two hypotheses of human female orgasm, we administered a questionnaire to 138 females and 121 males who reported that they were currently in a romantic relationship. Key predictions of the female fidelity hypothesis were not supported. In particular, orgasm was not associated with female sexual fidelity nor was orgasm associated with male perceptions of partner sexual fidelity. However, faked orgasm was associated with female sexual infidelity and lower male relationship satisfaction. Overall, results were in greater support of the sire choice signaling hypothesis than the female fidelity hypothesis. Results also suggest that male satisfaction with, investment in, and sexual fidelity to a mate are benefits that favored the selection of orgasmic signaling in ancestral females.},

Although many authors have conceptualized cultural change as a Darwinian process, there is no generally agreed formal framework for defining key concepts such as natural selection, fitness, relatedness and altruism for the cultural case. Here, we present and explore such a framework using the Price equation. Assuming an isolated, independently measurable culturally transmitted trait, we show that cultural natural selection maximizes cultural fitness, a distinct quantity from genetic fitness, and also that cultural relatedness and cultural altruism are not reducible to or necessarily related to their genetic counterparts. We show that antagonistic coevolution will occur between genes and culture whenever cultural fitness is not perfectly aligned with genetic fitness, as genetic selection will shape psychological mechanisms to avoid susceptibility to cultural traits that bear a genetic fitness cost. We discuss the difficulties with conceptualizing cultural change using the framework of evolutionary theory, the degree to which cultural evolution is autonomous from genetic evolution, and the extent to which cultural change should be seen as a Darwinian process. We argue that the nonselection components of evolutionary change are much more important for culture than for genes, and that this and other important differences from the genetic case mean that different approaches and emphases are needed for cultural than genetic processes.},

Endogenous selection bias can result from direct conditioning on the outcome variable, a post-outcome variable, a post-treatment variable, and even a pre-treatment variable. We highlight the difference between endogenous selection bias, common-cause confounding, and overcontrol bias and discuss numerous examples from social stratification, cultural sociology, social network analysis, political sociology, social demography, and the sociology of education.},

Investigating whether nonhuman communication systems are also combinatorial is hampered by difficulties in identifying the extent to which vocalizations are constructed from shared, meaningless building blocks. Here we present an approach to circumvent this difficulty and show that a pair of functionally distinct chestnut-crowned babbler ( Pomatostomus ruficeps ) vocalizations can be decomposed into perceptibly distinct, meaningless entities that are shared across the 2 calls. Specifically, by focusing on the acoustic distinctiveness of sound elements using a habituation-discrimination paradigm on wild-caught babblers under standardized aviary conditions, we show that 2 multielement calls are composed of perceptibly distinct sounds that are reused in different arrangements across the 2 calls. Furthermore, and critically, we show that none of the 5 constituent elements elicits functionally relevant responses in receivers, indicating that the constituent sounds do not carry the meaning of the call and so are contextually meaningless. Our work, which allows combinatorial systems in animals to be more easily identified, suggests that animals can produce functionally distinct calls that are built in a way superficially reminiscent of the way that humans produce morphemes and words. The results reported lend credence to the recent idea that language's combinatorial system may have been preceded by a superficial stage where signalers neither needed to be cognitively aware of the combinatorial strategy in place, nor of its building blocks.}

  abstract = {During group movements, many socially living and group-foraging animals produce contact calls. Contact calls typically function to coordinate and maintain cohesion among group members by providing receivers with information on the callers' location or movement-related motivation. Previous work suggests that meerkats, Suricata suricatta, also produce short-range contact calls, so-called `close calls', while foraging to maintain group cohesion. Yet, the underlying mechanism of how meerkats coordinate cohesion via close calling is unclear. Using a combination of field observations and playback experiments we here show that foraging meerkats adjusted the call rates of their continuously produced close calls depending on their spatial position to group members. Specifically, meerkats called at higher rates when foraging at a closer distance to and when surrounded by conspecifics; however, the number of calling individuals or their call rates did not affect a subject's close call rate. Overall, close call playbacks elicited a call response in receivers and attracted them to the sound source. Our results suggest that differences in individual close call rates are determined by a meerkat's proximity to other group members, being assessed through their vocal interactions. We discuss how local differences in individual call rates may extrapolate to the group level, where emerging `vocal hotspots' indicate areas of high individual density, in turn attracting and potentially guiding group members' movements. Hence, the described pattern illustrates a so far undocumented call mechanism where local differences in the call rates of continuously produced close calls can generate a group level pattern that mediates the cohesion of progressively moving animal groups.},

These preferences may appear in response to biological signals, or in situations where there is no obvious signalling context, such as exploratory behaviour and human aesthetic response to pattern. It has been proposed that preferences for symmetry have evolved in animals because the degree of symmetry in signals indicates the signaller's quality. By contrast, we show here that symmetry preferences may arise as a by-product of the need to recognize objects irrespective of their position and orientation in the visual field. The existence of sensory biases for symmetry may have been exploited independently by natural selection acting on biological signals and by human artistic innovation. This may account for the observed convergence on symmetrical forms in nature and decorative art.},

  abstract = {Biological displays are often symmetrical, and there is growing evidence that receivers are sensitive to these symmetries. One explanation for the evolution of such sensitivity is that symmetry reflects the quality of the signaller. An alternative is that the sensitivity may arise as a by-product of general properties of biological recognition systems. In line with the latter idea, simulations of the recognition process based on simple, artificial neural networks have suggested that generalization can give rise to preferences for particular symmetrical stimuli. However, it is not clear from these studies exactly how the preferences emerge, and to what extent the results are relevant to biological recognition systems. Here, we employ a different class of recognition models (gradient interaction models) to demonstrate more clearly how generalization can generate a preference for symmetrical variants of a display. We also point out that the predictions of the gradient interaction and network-based models regarding the effects of generalization closely match the results from empirical studies of stimulus control. Our analysis demonstrates that the effects of generalization cannot be ignored when studying the evolution of symmetry preferences and symmetric signals.},

The results of these tests provide considerable support for a diffusional-historic, as opposed to a functional-evolutionary, explanation of song-style variance.

As such, mimetic patterns are commonly circumscribed into discrete mimicry complexes, each containing a predominant phenotype. Outside a few examples in butterflies, the location of transition zones between mimicry complexes and the factors driving mimicry zones has rarely been examined. To infer the patterns and processes of M\"ullerian mimicry, we integrate large-scale data on the geographical distribution of colour patterns of social bumblebees across the contiguous United States and use these to quantify colour pattern mimicry using an innovative, unsupervised machine-learning approach based on computer vision. Our data suggest that bumblebees exhibit geographically clustered, but sometimes imperfect colour patterns, and that mimicry patterns gradually transition spatially rather than exhibit discrete boundaries. Additionally, examination of colour pattern transition zones of three comimicking, polymorphic species, where active selection is driving phenotype frequencies, revealed that their transition zones differ in location within a broad region of poor mimicry. Potential factors influencing mimicry transition zone dynamics are discussed.}

  abstract = {When a population exhibits collective cognitive alignment, such that group members tend to perceive, remember, and reproduce information in similar ways, the features of socially transmitted variants (i.e., artifacts, behaviors) may converge over time towards culture-specific equilibria points, often called cultural attractors. Because cognition may be plastic, shaped through experience with the cultural products of others, collective cognitive alignment and stable cultural attractors cannot always be taken for granted, but little is known about how these patterns first emerge and stabilize in initially uncoordinated populations. We propose that stable cultural attractors can emerge from general principles of human categorization and communication. We present a model of cultural attractor dynamics, which extends a model of unsupervised category learning in individuals to a multiagent setting wherein learners provide the training input to each other. Agents in our populations spontaneously align their cognitive category structures, producing emergent cultural attractor points. We highlight three interesting behaviors exhibited by our model: (1) noise enhances the stability of cultural category structures; (2) short `critical' periods of learning early in life enhance stability; and (3) larger populations produce more stable but less complex attractor landscapes, and cliquish network structure can mitigate the latter effect. These results may shed light on how collective cognitive alignment is achieved in the absence of shared, innate cognitive attractors, which we suggest is important to the capacity for cumulative cultural evolution.},

We had predicted that strangers would be matched most, because previous work had shown an association between matching and a strong response. An analysis using a difference index showed that the birds matched most often when the stimulus song was very similar in detailed structure to their own rendition of the song. This was confirmed in a second experiment in which we played `similar' and `different' renditions recorded from strangers. However, once the effect of similarity was partialled out there was a residual tendency to match strangers more than neighbours, as we had first predicted. We discuss the implications of these results for perception of song categories by the birds, possible use by the birds of their own songs as `standards' and the functional significance of matching.},

I then show that such second-degree rewiring has less impact on important structural properties of the network than forming random new connections. For example, in a network with phenotypic assortment, second-degree nodes are more likely to be similar than any random pair of nodes, and connecting these will better maintain assortativity. This simple rule can therefore maintain network properties without individuals having any knowledge of the global structure of the network or the relative properties of the nodes within it.{$<$}/li{$>$} {$<$}li{$>$}In this paper, I outline an algorithm for second-degree rewiring.

I then demonstrate empirically, using social networks of great tits (\emph{Parus major}), that individuals that previously shared connections to a removed conspecific were more likely to form a new connection or to strengthen their connection, relative to other individuals in the same population.             {$<$}/li{$>$} {$<$}li{$>$}This study highlights how developing a better mechanistic understanding of the structural properties of networks, and the consequences of adding new connections, can provide useful insights into how organisms are likely to regulate their interactions in shrinking populations.{$<$}/li{$>$} {$<$}/ol{$>$}}

We used automated technologies to track 1053 individuals that formed 73 737 groups from which we inferred a social network. Our framework identified that both social and spatial drivers contributed to assortment in the network. In particular, groups had a more even sex ratio than expectedand exhibited a consistent age structure that suggested local association preferences, such as preferential attachment or avoidance. By contrast, recent immigrants were spatially partitioned from locally born individuals, suggesting differential dispersal strategies by phenotype. Our results highlight how different scales of social decision-making, ranging from post-natal dispersal settlement to fission\textendash fusion dynamics, can interact to drive phenotypic structure in animal populations.},

Recent studies have found that permutation tests, which are widely used to test hypotheses when working with animal social network data, can suffer from high rates of type I error (false positives) and type II error (false negatives). Here, we first outline why pre-network and node permutation tests have elevated type I and II error rates. We then propose a new procedure, the double permutation test, that addresses some of the limitations of existing approaches by combining pre-network and node permutations. We conduct a range of simulations, allowing us to estimate error rates under different scenarios, including errors caused by confounding effects of social or non-social structure in the raw data. We show that double permutation tests avoid elevated type I errors, while remaining sufficiently sensitive to avoid elevated type II errors. By contrast, the existing solutions we tested, including node permutations, pre-network permutations, and regression models with control variables, all exhibit elevated errors under at least one set of simulated conditions. Type I error rates from double permutation remain close to 5\% in the same scenarios where type I error rates from pre-network permutation tests exceed 30\%. The double permutation test provides a potential solution to issues arising from elevated type I and type II error rates when testing hypotheses with social network data. We also discuss other approaches, including restricted node permutations, testing multiple null hypotheses, and splitting large datasets to generate replicated networks, that can strengthen our ability to make robust inferences. Finally, we highlight ways that uncertainty can be explicitly considered during the analysis using permutation-based or Bayesian methods. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

In his reply to it, Dennett agreed that more pluralism is needed. Our paper's main point was to urge cultural evolutionists to get their hands dirty by describing the fine details of cultural products and by striving to offer detailed and, when explanatory, varied algorithms or mechanisms to account for them. While Dennett's latest work on cultural evolution does marvelously well on the first point, it has only whet our appetite on the second. Accordingly, the present paper aims to show what an evolutionary explanation of culture that takes the variety of cultural evolution mechanisms seriously would look like. We will focus on the cultural evolution of social epistemic mechanisms (i.e. social mechanisms that aim to deliver epistemically valued judgements) and we will propose that Darwinian algorithms should be complemented with a cultural analogue of the error reduction mechanism proposed to account for human cognition, with a particular emphasis on the necessity to build independencies (known as "Markov blankets") between different sub-systems in charge of tracking states of the world. To illustrate our point, we will present how the evolution of the legal system as epistemic systems can be understood as a process of building increasingly better independencies and how various criticisms of the actual legal system calls for building even more of them.}

  abstract = {The extent to which larger populations enhance cumulative cultural evolution (CCE) is contentious. We report a large-scale experiment (n = 543) that investigates the CCE of technology (paper planes and their flight distances) using a transmission-chain design. Population size was manipulated such that participants could learn from the paper planes constructed by one, two, or four models from the prior generation. These social-learning conditions were compared with an asocial individual-learning condition in which individual participants made repeated attempts at constructing a paper plane, without having access to any planes produced by other participants. Larger populations generated greater variation in plane performance and gave participants access to better-adapted planes, but this did not enhance CCE. In fact, there was an inverse relationship between population size and CCE: plane flight distance did not improve over the experimental generations in the 2-Model and 4-Model conditions, but did improve over generations in the 1-Model social-learning condition. The incremental improvement in plane flight distance in the 1-Model social-learning condition was comparable to that in the Individual Learning condition, highlighting the importance of trial-and-error learning to artifact innovation and adaptation. An exploratory analysis indicated that the greater variation participants had access to in the larger populations may have overwhelmed their working memory and weakened their ability to selectively copy the best-adapted plane(s). We conclude that larger populations do not enhance artifact performance via CCE, and that it may be only under certain specific conditions that larger population sizes enhance CCE.},

  abstract = {Socially learned signals and behaviors are found throughout the animal kingdom and often show striking variation within species over space and time. However, the extent to which this cultural diversity is generated by demographic factors such as immigration and dispersal has proved difficult to investigate and remains largely untested in a natural setting. Focusing on 14 different local neighborhoods within a wild population of great tits Parus major, we examined the relationship between individual movements over a 7-year period and patterns of cultural diversity at a neighborhood level, assessed using 2 indices: Song repertoire size and repertoire novelty, measured at the neighborhood (but not individual) level. We found that the repertoire size of a neighborhood is positively correlated with its levels of immigration, but that repertoire novelty is constrained by dispersal and geographic proximity among neighborhoods, both of which promote song sharing. In parallel, we show that the acoustic structure of some songs changes subtly over distance, in line with the view that learning errors can lead to the establishment of novel social traits (cultural differentiation). Our findings demonstrate that spatial variation in cultural diversity in animal societies can partly be explained as the outcome of dispersal and immigration transferring traits between neighborhoods and also suggest that trait transmission declines in fidelity over distance. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Author.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 The Author(s). Background: Vocal sequences - utterances consisting of calls produced in close succession - are common phenomena in animal communication. While many studies have explored the adaptive benefits of producing such sequences, very little is known about how the costs and constraints involved in their production affect their form. Here, we investigated this issue in the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) pant hoot, a long and structurally complex vocal sequence comprising four acoustically distinct phases - introduction, build-up, climax and let-down. Results: We found that in each of these phases, and for the sequence as a whole, there was a negative relationship between the number of calls produced and their average duration. There was also a negative relationship between the total duration of some adjacent phases. Significant relationships between the fundamental frequency of calls and their number or duration were found for some phases of the sequence, but the direction of these relationships differed between particular phases. Conclusions: These results indicate that there are trade-offs in terms of signal duration at two levels in pant-hoot production: between call number and duration, and between the relative durations of successive phases. These trade-offs are likely to reflect biomechanical constraints on vocal sequence production. Phase-specific trade-offs also appear to occur between fundamenta l frequency and call number or duration, potentially reflecting that different phases of the sequence are associated with distinct types of information, linked in different ways to call pitch. Overall, this study highlights the important role of costs and constraints in shaping the temporal and acoustic structure of animal vocal sequences.},

  abstract = {Culture is typically viewed as consisting of traits inherited epigenetically, through social learning. However, cultural diversity has species-typical constraints, presumably of genetic origin. A celebrated, if contentious, example is whether a universal grammar constrains syntactic diversity in human languages. Oscine songbirds exhibit song learning and provide biologically tractable models of cultue: members of a species show individual variation in song and geographically separated groups have local song dialects. Different species exhibit distinct song cultures, suggestive of genetic constraints. Without such constraints, innovations and copying errors should cause unbounded variation over multiple generations or geographical distance, contrary to observations. Here we report an experiment designed to determine whether wild-type song culture might emerge over multiple generations in an isolated colony founded by isolates, and, if so, how this might happen and what type of social environment is required. Zebra finch isolates, unexposed to singing males during development, produce song with characteristics that differ from the wild-type song found in laboratory or natural colonies. In tutoring lineages starting from isolate founders, we quantified alterations in song across tutoring generations in two social environments: tutor-pupil pairs in sound-isolated chambers and an isolated semi-natural colony. In both settings, juveniles imitated the isolate tutors but changed certain characteristics of the songs. These alterations accumulated over learning generations. Consequently, songs evolved towards the wild-type in three to four generations. Thus, species-typical song culture can appear de novo. Our study has parallels with language change and evolution. In analogy to models in quantitative genetics, we model song culture as a multigenerational phenotype partly encoded genetically in an isolate founding population, influenced by environmental variables and taking multiple generations to emerge.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors. At the onset of vocal development, both songbirds and humans produce variable vocal babbling with broadly distributed acoustic features. Over development, these vocalizations differentiate into the well-defined, categorical signals that characterize adult vocal behaviour. A broadly distributed signal is ideal for vocal exploration, that is, for matching vocal production to the statistics of the sensory input. The developmental transition to categorical signals is a gradual process during which the vocal output becomes differentiated and stable. But does it require categorical input? We trained juvenile zebra finches with playbacks of their own developing song, produced just a few moments earlier, updated continuously over development. Although the vocalizations of these self-tutored (ST) birds were initially broadly distributed, birds quickly developed categorical signals, as fast as birds that were trained with a categorical, adult song template. By contrast, siblings of those birds that received no training (isolates) developed phonological categories much more slowly and never reached the same level of category differentiation as their ST brothers. Therefore, instead of simply mirroring the statistical properties of their sensory input, songbirds actively transform it into distinct categories. We suggest that the early self-generation of phonological categories facilitates the establishment of vocal culture by making the song easier to transmit at the micro level, while promoting stability of shared vocabulary at the group level over generations.},

We explore the influence of categories on perception through one such phenomenon, the perceptual magnet effect, in which discriminability between vowels is reduced near prototypical vowel sounds. We present a Bayesian model to explain why this reduced discriminability might occur: It arises as a consequence of optimally solving the statistical problem of perception in noise. In the optimal solution to this problem, listeners' perception is biased toward phonetic category means because they use knowledge of these categories to guide their inferences about speakers' target productions. Simulations show that model predictions closely correspond to previously published human data, and novel experimental results provide evidence for the predicted link between perceptual warping and noise. The model unifies several previous accounts of the perceptual magnet effect and provides a framework for exploring categorical effects in other domains.},

In northwest Spain, brown bears Ursus arctos are strictly protected, whereas sympatric wolves Canis lupus are subject to lethal control. We explored ecological, economic and societal components of conflict scenarios involving large carnivores and damages to human properties. We analyzed the relation between complaints of depredations by bears and wolves on beehives and livestock, respectively, and bear and wolf abundance, livestock heads, number of culled wolves, amount of paid compensations, and media coverage. We also evaluated the efficiency of wolf culling to reduce depredations on livestock. Bear damages to beehives correlated positively to the number of female bears with cubs of the year. Complaints of wolf predation on livestock were unrelated to livestock numbers; instead, they correlated positively to the number of wild ungulates harvested during the previous season, the number of wolf packs, and to wolves culled during the previous season. Compensations for wolf complaints were fivefold higher than for bears, but media coverage of wolf damages was thirtyfold higher. Media coverage of wolf damages was unrelated to the actual costs of wolf damages, but the amount of news correlated positively to wolf culling. However, wolf culling was followed by an increase in compensated damages. Our results show that culling of the wolf population failed in its goal of reducing damages, and suggest that management decisions are at least partly mediated by press coverage. We suggest that our results provide insight to similar scenarios, where several species of large carnivores share the landscape with humans, and management may be reactive to perceived conflicts.},

Current developmental psychological theories propose that this pattern of mother-infant exchange promotes the regulation of infant emotions [4-6] and serves as a precursor of more complex forms of social exchange including perspective taking and empathy. Here we report that in rhesus macaques, mother-infant pairs also communicate intersubjectively via complex forms of emotional exchanges including exaggerated lipsmacking, sustained mutual gaze, mouth-mouth contacts, and neonatal imitation. Infant macaques solicit their mother's affiliative responses and actively communicate to her. However, this form of communication disappears within the infant's first month of life. Our data challenge the view that the mother-infant communicative system functions in order to sustain proximity and that infants are simply passive recipients in such interaction. Thus, emotional communication between mother and infant is not uniquely human. Instead, we can trace back to macaques the evolutionary foundation of those behaviors that are crucial for the establishment of a functional capacity to socially exchange with others.},

  abstract = {Individual identification is a crucial step to answer many questions in evolutionary biology and is mostly performed by marking animals with tags. Such methods are well established but often make data collection and analyses time consuming and consequently are not suited for collecting very large datasets. Recent technological and analytical advances, such as deep learning, can help overcome these limitations by automatizing data collection and analysis. Currently one of the bottlenecks preventing the application of deep learning for individual identification is the need of hundreds to thousands of labelled pictures required for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Here, we describe procedures that improve data collection and allow individual identification in captive and wild birds and we apply it to three small bird species, the sociable weaver Philetairus socius, the great tit Parus major and the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata. First, we present an automated method that allows the collection of large samples of individually labelled images. Second, we describe how to train a CNN to identify individuals. Third, we illustrate the general applicability of CNN for individual identification in animal studies by showing that the trained CNN can predict the identity of birds from images collected in contexts that differ from the ones originally used to train the CNNs. Fourth, we present a potential solution to solve the issues of new incoming individuals. Overall our work demonstrates the feasibility of applying state-of-the-art deep learning tools for individual identification of birds, both in the lab and in the wild. These techniques are made possible by our approaches that allow efficient collection of training data. The ability to conduct individual identification of birds without requiring external markers that can be visually identified by human observers represents a major advance over current methods.}

Determining the span of correlations in dolphin whistle sequences is crucial for shedding light on their communicative complexity. Dolphin whistles share various statistical properties with human words, i.e. Zipf's law for word frequencies (namely that the probability of the \$i\$th most frequent word of a text is about \$i\^\{-\textbackslash alpha\}\$) and a parallel of the tendency of more frequent words to have more meanings. The finding of Zipf's law for word frequencies in dolphin whistles has been the topic of an intense debate on its implications. One of the major arguments against the relevance of Zipf's law in dolphin whistles is that is not possible to distinguish the outcome of a die rolling experiment from that of a linguistic or communicative source producing Zipf's law for word frequencies. Here we show that statistically significant whistle-whistle correlations extend back to the 2nd previous whistle in the sequence using a global randomization test and to the 4th previous whistle using a local randomization test. None of these correlations are expected by a die rolling experiment and other simple explanation of Zipf's law for word frequencies such as Simon's model that produce sequences of unpredictable elements.},

It has been argued that the presence of this law is a sign of efficient coding in the information theoretic sense. However, no strong direct connection has been demonstrated between the law and compression, the information theoretic principle of minimizing the expected length of a code. Here, we show that minimizing the expected code length implies that the length of a word cannot increase as its frequency increases. Furthermore, we show that the mean code length or duration is significantly small in human language, and also in the behavior of other species in all cases where agreement with the law of brevity has been found. We argue that compression is a general principle of animal behavior that reflects selection for efficiency of coding.},

In this study, we present a purely bottom-up approach for mapping the concepts that emerge from sound qualities. A social media (http://www.last.fm) is used to obtain a wide sample of verbal descriptions of music (in the form of tags) that go beyond the commonly studied concept of genre, and from this the underlying semantic structure of this sample is extracted. The structure that is thereby obtained is then evaluated through a careful investigation of the acoustic features that characterize it. The results outline the degree to which such structures in music (connected to affects, instrumentation and performance characteristics) have particular timbral characteristics. Samples representing these semantic structures were then submitted to a similarity rating experiment to validate the findings. The outcome of this experiment strengthened the discovered links between the semantic structures and their perceived timbral qualities. The findings of both the computational and behavioural parts of the experiment imply that it is therefore possible to derive useful and meaningful structures from free verbal descriptions of music, that transcend musical genres, and that such descriptions can be linked to a set of acoustic features. This approach not only provides insights into the definition of timbre from an ecological perspective, but could also be implemented to develop applications in music information research that organize music collections according to both semantic and sound qualities.},

  abstract = {According to current theory, the development of different conspicuous ornaments may provide multiple, redundant or unreliable information. However, multiple visual and acoustic traits have not often been tested at the same time. In this study, we analyse whether black tie size, yellow breast colour indexes (chroma and hue) and song parameters (repertoire size, strophe length, maximum and minimum frequency) are inter-correlated in male great tits (Parus major). We found that males with larger black ties sang greater repertoires and had higher song frequencies, providing redundant information. However, song parameters did not correlate with hue and chroma of the yellow breast coloration, supporting the idea that they convey different units of information. Results therefore stress that since different plumaged patches can transmit very different units of information, bird song will correlate to plumage coloration traits depending on the patch and the colour considered, an aspect rarely taken into account in previous studies relating song to plumage colour traits.},

There is an ongoing debate about whether a complex stimulus such as music can improve memory, and in particular memory for words, rather than interfere with correct encoding of information. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate whether verbal episodic memory can be improved by background context of instrumental music. Twenty young adults were asked to memorize different lists of words presented against a background of music, environmental sounds or silence. Their episodic memory performance was then tested in terms of item and source memory scores. Results revealed better memory performance under the music condition than with environmental sounds or silence in the retrieval of the context (i.e. source) of the encoded material. These findings, contrasting with studies showing an interfering effect of music, are discussed in terms of both methodological and theoretical perspectives with the aim of furthering the debate about music and memory. In sum, our results indicate that music can specifically act as a facilitating encoding context for verbal episodic memory, opening important perspectives for music as a rehabilitation tool for episodic memory deficits.},

However, several findings suggest that music can also interfere with memory performance. A better understanding of the behavioral and neural processes involved can substantially improve knowledge and shed new light on the most efficient music-based interventions. Based on fNIRS studies on music, episodic encoding, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), this work aims to extend previous findings by monitoring the entire lateral PFC during both encoding and retrieval of verbal material. Nineteen participants were asked to encode lists of words presented with either background music or silence and subsequently tested during a free recall task. Meanwhile, their PFC was monitored using a 48-channel fNIRS system. Behavioral results showed greater chunking of words under the music condition, suggesting the employment of associative strategies for items encoded with music. fNIRS results showed that music provided a less demanding way of modulating both episodic encoding and retrieval, with a general prefrontal decreased activity under the music versus silence condition. This suggests that music-related memory processes rely on specific neural mechanisms and that music can positively influence both episodic encoding and retrieval of verbal information.},

Under strict protection, the expansion of a new wolf population has been taking place on the Scandinavian Peninsula since the late 1980s, leading to much controvery in rural areas. Most research on conflicts concerning wolves has taken antagonistic attitudes as a point of departure. In this article we question such an approach. Taking social representations as our framework for analysis, our aim has been to find out how wolves are perceived and whether an analysis of such cultural meanings could contribute to a better understanding of the conflicts accompanying wolf recovery. Focus group interviews in two areas in Eastern Norway suggest that it is not antagonistic interpretations of the carnivores' nature that fuel the conflicts over wolves, but different views as to whether they belong in the areas where they are now found. Yet, at the same time, it is against the undisputed background of the wolf's perceived character that the negotiations over their belonging to Norwegian nature make sense. We so argue that the theory of social representations provides a comprehensive framework for studying the complex relationship between consensus and diverging opinions, and between culturally embedded representations and conflict, that appears to lie at the heart of such issues.},

Here we present an extensive sampling of relative brain sizes in fossil and extant taxa in the mammalian order Carnivora (cats, dogs, bears, weasels, and their relatives). By using Akaike Information Criterion model selection and endocranial volume and body mass data for 289 species (including 125 fossil taxa), we document clade-specific evolutionary transformations in encephalization allometries. These evolutionary transformations include multiple independent encephalization increases and decreases in addition to a remarkably static basal Carnivora allometry that characterizes much of the suborder Feliformia and some taxa in the suborder Caniformia across much of their evolutionary history, emphasizing that complex processes shaped the modern distribution of encephalization across Carnivora. This analysis also permits critical evaluation of the social brain hypothesis (SBH), which predicts a close association between sociality and increased encephalization. Previous analyses based on living species alone appeared to support the SBH with respect to Carnivora, but those results are entirely dependent on data from modern Canidae (dogs). Incorporation of fossil data further reveals that no association exists between sociality and encephalization across Carnivora and that support for sociality as a causal agent of encephalization increase disappears for this clade.},

In this article, we review common questions in animal behaviour that can be studied using a multilayer approach, and we link these questions to specific analyses. We outline the types of behavioural data and questions that may be suitable to study using multilayer network analysis. We detail several multilayer methods, which can provide new insights into questions about animal sociality at individual, group, population and evolutionary levels of organization. We give examples for how to implement multilayer methods to demonstrate how taking a multilayer approach can alter inferences about social structure and the positions of individuals within such a structure. Finally, we discuss caveats to undertaking multilayer network analysis in the study of animal social networks, and we call attention to methodological challenges for the application of these approaches.

By imposing specified rules controlling individual access to feeding stations, we directly manipulated the foraging social network of a wild bird community, thus demonstrating how external factors can shape social structure. We show that experimentally imposed constraints were carried over into patterns of association at unrestricted, ephemeral food patches, as well as at nesting sites during breeding territory prospecting. Hence, different social contexts can be causally linked, and constraints at one level may have consequences that extend into other aspects of sociality. Finally, the imposed assortment was lost following the cessation of the experimental manipulation, indicating the potential for previously perturbed social networks of wild animals to recover from segregation driven by external constraints.},

We then provided novel ephemeral food patches freely accessible to all birds and recorded the spread of this new information. We demonstrate that the discovery of new food patches followed the experimentally imposed social structure and that birds disproportionately learnt from those whom they could forage with at the selective feeders. The selective feeders reduced the number of conspecific information sources available and birds subsequently increased their use of information provided by heterospecifics. Our study demonstrates that changes to social systems carry over into pathways of information transfer and that individuals learn from tutors that provide relevant information in other contexts.},

How individuals are positioned within the wider social network (i.e. their indirect social connections) has been shown to be repeatable, heritable and related to key life-history variables. Yet, there remains a general lack of understanding surrounding how complex network positions arise, whether they indicate active multifaceted social decisions by individuals, and how natural selection could act on this variation. We use simulations to assess how variation in simple social association rules between individuals can determine their positions within emerging social networks. Our results show that metrics of individuals' indirect connections can be more strongly related to underlying simple social differences than metrics of their dyadic connections. External influences causing network noise (typical of animal social networks) generally inflated these differences. The findings demonstrate that relationships between complex network positions and other behaviours or fitness components do not provide sufficient evidence for the presence, or importance, of complex social behaviours, even if direct network metrics provide less explanatory power than indirect ones. Interestingly however, a plausible and straightforward heritable basis for complex network positions can arise from simple social differences, which in turn creates potential for selection to act on indirect connections.},

The ability to represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external information and increase efficiency. In order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive, using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced by cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network. Our results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of information-processing that is mediated by both the core and dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably reducing information processing load.},

  abstract = {The complex and melodic nature of many birds' songs has raised interest in potential parallels between avian vocal sequences and human speech. The similarities between birdsong and speech in production and learning are well established, but surprisingly little is known about how birds perceive song sequences. One popular laboratory songbird, the zebra finch (\emph{Taeniopygia guttata}), has recently attracted attention as an avian model for human speech, in part because the male learns to produce the individual elements in its song motif in a fixed sequence. But psychoacoustic evidence shows that adult zebra finches are relatively insensitive to the sequential features of song syllables. Instead, zebra finches and other birds seem to be exquisitely sensitive to the acoustic details of individual syllables to a degree that is beyond human hearing capacity. Based on these findings, we present a finite-state model of zebra finch perception of song syllable sequences and discuss the rich informational capacity of their vocal system. Furthermore, we highlight the abilities of budgerigars (\emph{Melopsittacus undulatus}), a parrot species, to hear sequential features better than zebra finches and suggest that neurophysiological investigations comparing these species could prove fruitful for uncovering neural mechanisms for auditory sequence perception in human speech.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Reproductive success is often highly skewed in animal populations. Yet the processes leading to this are not always clear. Similarly, connections in animal social networks are often nonrandomly distributed, with some individuals with many connections and others with few, yet whether there are simple explanations for this pattern has not been determined. Numerous social interactions involve dyads embedded within a wider network. As a result, it may be possible to model which individuals accumulate social interactions through a more general understanding of the social network's structure, and how this structure changes over time. We analysed fighting and mating interactions across the breeding season in a population of wild field crickets under surveillance from a network of video cameras. We fitted stochastic actor-oriented models to determine the dynamic process by which networks of cricket fighting and mating interactions form, and how they co-influence each other. We found crickets tended to fight those in close spatial proximity to them and those possessing a mutual connection in the fighting network, and heavier crickets fought more often. We also found that crickets that mated with many others tended to fight less in the following time period. This demonstrates that a mixture of spatial constraints, characteristics of individuals and characteristics of the immediate social environment are key for determining social interactions. The mating interaction network required very few parameters to understand its growth and thus its structure; only homophily by mating success was required to simulate the skew of mating interactions seen in this population. This demonstrates that relatively simple, but dynamic, processes can give highly skewed distributions of mating success.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Rare mutations of the FOXP2 transcription factor gene cause a monogenic syndrome characterized by impaired speech development and linguistic deficits. Recent genomic investigations indicate that its downstream neural targets make broader impacts on common language impairments, bridging clinically distinct disorders. Moreover, the striking conservation of both FoxP2 sequence and neural expression in different vertebrates facilitates the use of animal models to study ancestral pathways that have been recruited towards human speech and language. Intriguingly, reduced FoxP2 dosage yields abnormal synaptic plasticity and impaired motor-skill learning in mice, and disrupts vocal learning in songbirds. Converging data indicate that Foxp2 is important for modulating the plasticity of relevant neural circuits. This body of research represents the first functional genetic forays into neural mechanisms contributing to human spoken language. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}I explore the neural and evolutionary origins of phonological hierarchy, building on Peter MacNeilage's frame/content model, which suggests that human speech evolved from primate nonvocal jaw oscillations, for example, lip smack displays, combined with phonation. Considerable recent data, reviewed here, support this proposition. I argue that the evolution of speech motor control required two independent components. The first, identified by MacNeilage, is the diversification of phonetic "content" within a simple sequential "frame," and would be within reach of nonhuman primates, by simply intermittently activating phonation during lip smack displays. Such voicing control requires laryngeal control, hypothesized to necessitate direct corticomotor connections to the nucleus ambiguus. The second component, proposed here, involves imposing additional hierarchical rhythmic structure upon the "flat" control sequences typifying mammalian vocal tract oscillations and is required for the flexible combinatorial capacity observed in modern phonology. I hypothesize that phonological hierarchy resulted from a marriage of a preexisting capacity for sequential structure seen in other primates, with novel hierarchical motor control circuitry (potentially evolved in tool use and/or musical contexts). In turn, this phonological hierarchy paved the way for phrasal syntactic hierarchy. I support these arguments using comparative and neural data from nonhuman primates and birdsong.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Although considerable research has focused on the evolution of sexually selected traits, their underlying genetic architecture is poorly resolved. Here I address the pleiotropic effects and genomic locations of sexually selected genes. These two important characteristics can impose considerable constraints on evolvability and may influence our understanding of the process of sexual selection. Theoretical models are inconsistent regarding the genomic location of sexually selected genes. Models that do not incorporate pleiotropic effects often predict sex linkage. Conversely, sex linkage is not explicitly predicted by the condition-dependent model ( which considers pleiotropic effects). Evidence largely based on reciprocal crosses supports the notion of sex linkage. However, although they infer genetic contribution, reciprocal crosses cannot identify the genes or their pleiotropic effects. By surveying the genome of Drosophila melanogaster, I provide evidence for the genomic location and pleiotropic effects of 63 putatively sexually selected genes. Interestingly, most are pleiotropic (73\%), and they are not preferentially sex linked. Their pleiotropic effects include fertility, development, life span, and viability, which may contribute to condition and/or fitness. My findings may also provide evidence for the capture of genetic variation in condition via the pleiotropic effects of sexually selected genes.},

Other reproductive benefits of sexual pleasure and orgasm such as improved bonding of parents have also been discussed but not thoroughly. Although sex is known to be highly reinforcing, behaviorist principles are rarely invoked alongside evolutionary psychology in order to account for human sexual and social behavior. In this paper, I will argue that intense sexual pleasure, especially orgasm, can be understood as a primary reinforcer shaped by evolution to reinforce behavior that facilitates reproductive success (i.e. conception through copulation). Next, I will describe an evolutionary account of social shaping. In particular, I will focus on how humans evolved to use orgasm and sexual arousal to shape the social behavior and emotional states of others through both classical and operant conditioning and through both reproductive and non-reproductive forms of sexual behavior. Finally, I will describe how orgasm is a signal of sensitivity to reinforcement that is itself reinforcing.},

'Cultural niche construction' refers specifically to the effect of cultural traits on the selective environments of other biological or cultural traits and may be especially important in human evolution. In addition, the relationship between population size and cultural accumulation has been the subject of extensive debate, in part because anthropological studies have demonstrated a significant association between population size and toolkit complexity in only a subset of studied cultures. Here, we review the role of cultural innovation in constructing human evolutionary niches and introduce a new model to describe the accumulation of human cultural traits that incorporates the effects of cultural niche construction. We consider the results of this model in light of available data on human toolkit sizes across populations to help elucidate the important differences between food-gathering societies and food-producing societies, in which niche construction may be a more potent force. These results support the idea that a population's relationship with its environment, represented here by cultural niche construction, should be considered alongside population size in studies of cultural complexity.This article is part of the themed issue 'Process and pattern in innovations from cells to societies'.},

  abstract = {Human populations show rich cultural diversity. Underpinning this diversity of tools, rituals, and cultural norms are complex interactions between cultural evolutionary and demographic processes. Most models of cultural change assume that individuals use the same learning modes and methods throughout their lives. However, empirical data on `learning life histories'\textemdash the balance of dominant modes of learning (for example, learning from parents, peers, or unrelated elders) throughout an individual's lifetime\textemdash suggest that age structure may play a crucial role in determining learning modes and cultural evolutionary trajectories. Thus, studied in isolation, demographic and cultural evolutionary models show only part of the picture. This paper describes a mathematical and computational framework that combines demographic and cultural evolutionary methods. Using this general framework, we examine interactions between the ways in which culture is spread throughout an individual's lifetime and cultural change across generations. We show that including demographic structure alongside cultural dynamics can help to explain domain-specific patterns of cultural evolution that are a persistent feature of cultural data, and can shed new light on rare but significant demographic events.},

Elastin degradation in cerebral vessels is associated with cerebrovascular disease. The goal of this study is to assess the biomechanical properties of human cerebral arteries, their composition, and their geometry, with particular focus on the functional alteration of elastin attributable to aging. METHODS Twelve posterior cranial arteries obtained from human cadavers of 2 different age groups were compared morphologically and tested biomechanically before and after enzymatic degradation of elastin. Light, confocal, and scanning electron microscopy were used to analyze and determine structural differences, potentially attributed to aging. RESULTS Aging affects structural morphology and the mechanical properties of intracranial arteries. In contrast to main systemic arteries, intima and media thicken while outer diameter remains relatively constant with age, leading to concentric hypertrophy. The structural morphology of elastin changed from a fiber network oriented primarily in the circumferential direction to a more heterogeneously oriented fiber mesh, especially at the intima. Biomechanically, cerebral arteries stiffen with age and lose compliance in the elastin dominated regime. Enzymatic degradation of elastin led to loss in compliance and stiffening in the young group but did not affect the structural and material properties in the older group, suggesting that elastin, though present in equal quantities in the old group, becomes dysfunctional with aging. CONCLUSIONS Elastin loses its functionality in cerebral arteries with aging, leading to stiffer less compliant arteries. The area fraction of elastin remained, however, fairly constant. The loss of functionality may thus be attributed to fragmentation and structural reorganization of elastin occurring with age.},

We tested the social dynamics hypothesis, which states that males sing at dawn to mediate their social relationships with neighbors through interactive communication. Using a 16-microphone acoustic location system, we recorded 29 entire dawn choruses in 10 neighborhoods of 6-10 territorial male black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) of known dominance rank. We analyzed song frequency matching and overlapping between neighboring males in 10 choruses and compared the intensity of these behaviors with social factors. Chickadees matched the frequency of their neighbor's songs more often than expected by chance. The level of matching was higher between neighbors who belonged to different flocks during the previous winter than between neighbors who had been flockmates. Males of the same dominance rank matched each other more than males of disparate ranks. There was no relationship between matching and pairing status or distance between opponents. Overlapping was used less than expected by chance. No measures of song overlapping were related to measured social factors. Our results show that neighboring male chickadees interact vocally at dawn by frequency matching. This is the first study to show that the intensity of songbird vocal interactions at dawn varies with social factors, supporting the social dynamics hypothesis. \textcopyright{} The Author 2008.

Partial residual plots visualize lack of fit, traditionally in relatively simple additive regression models. We combine partial residuals with effect displays to visualize both fit and lack of fit simultaneously in complex regression models, plotting residuals from a model around 2D slices of the fitted response surface. Employing fundamental results on partial residual plots along with examples for both real and contrived data, we discuss and illustrate both the strengths and limitations of the resulting graphs.

Studies on the importance of having a large repertoire typically assume the available song types as a fixed trait. However, repertoire composition may be flexible. We explored the effects of playbacks on the composition and use of the song type repertoire in great tits, Parus major. Playbacks simulate a nearby competitor male, vocally advertising territoriality. We compared the effects of novel song types with two control groups, one in which we played back one of the song types from the repertoire of the focal individual, and one without playback. The repertoire size for individual great tits of actively used song types remained more or less constant, but playbacks led to a significant turnover in repertoire composition over a relatively short period (about a week). The repertoire assessment across three experimental phases led to significantly larger accumulated repertoires compared to the more traditional short-term assessment method. The appearance of new song types was especially prominent among birds treated with a novel song type, suggesting the process is socially mediated. None of the 'new' song types were accurate copies of the novel unfamiliar song types played back. We discuss the potential origin of these 'new' song types and the impact of repertoire plasticity on signal value for sexual selection. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Although these highly influential drum breaks (sometimes called breakbeats) have been integral to much of the hip-hop and other music produced in recent decades, there has been little scholarly investigation of their rhythmic features. To that end, this study examined 30 classic drum breaks from the ``breakbeat canon,'' focusing primarily on sixteenth-note swing (a systematic delay of even-numbered sixteenth-note divisions of the pulse). Such swing was common among the examined drum breaks, though the magnitude of swing was often fairly subtle (median swing ratio = 1.2:1). In contrast to some findings regarding jazz drumming, the magnitude of swing was uncorrelated with tempo, though the ranges of both variables were somewhat constrained. Backbeat delay (a systematic delay of snare drum at even-numbered beats) was found to be frequently present at beat 2, but not at beat 4. Additionally, this study introduces a quantity called ``swing density,'' defined as the proportion of even-numbered divisions (at the swing level) that contain events. The importance of this quantity to the perceptual effect of swing is discussed.},

  abstract = {We typically observe large-scale outcomes that arise from the interactions of many hidden, small-scale processes. Examples include age of disease onset, rates of amino acid substitutions, and composition of ecological communities. The macroscopic patterns in each problem often vary around a characteristic shape that can be generated by neutral processes. A neutral generative model assumes that each microscopic process follows unbiased stochastic fluctuations: random connections of network nodes; amino acid substitutions with no effect on fitness; species that arise or disappear from communities randomly. These neutral generative models often match common patterns of nature. In this paper, I present the theoretical background by which we can understand why these neutral generative models are so successful. I show how the classic patterns such as Poisson and Gaussian arise. Each classic pattern was often discovered by a simple neutral generative model. The neutral patterns share a special characteristic: they describe the patterns of nature that follow from simple constraints on information. For example, any aggregation of processes that preserves information only about the mean and variance attracts to the Gaussian pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the mean attracts to the exponential pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about the geometric mean attracts to the power law pattern. I present an informational framework of the common patterns of nature based on the method of maximum entropy. This framework shows that each neutral generative model is a special case that helps to discover a particular set of informational constraints; those informational constraints define a much wider domain of non-neutral generative processes that attract to the same neutral pattern.},

Heterosexual men were most likely to say they usually-always orgasmed when sexually intimate (95\%), followed by gay men (89\%), bisexual men (88\%), lesbian women (86\%), bisexual women (66\%), and heterosexual women (65\%). Compared to women who orgasmed less frequently, women who orgasmed more frequently were more likely to: receive more oral sex, have longer duration of last sex, be more satisfied with their relationship, ask for what they want in bed, praise their partner for something they did in bed, call/email to tease about doing something sexual, wear sexy lingerie, try new sexual positions, anal stimulation, act out fantasies, incorporate sexy talk, and express love during sex. Women were more likely to orgasm if their last sexual encounter included deep kissing, manual genital stimulation, and/or oral sex in addition to vaginal intercourse. We consider sociocultural and evolutionary explanations for these orgasm gaps. The results suggest a variety of behaviors couples can try to increase orgasm frequency.},

Complex social systems, compared with simple social systems, are those in which individuals frequently interact in many different contexts with many different individuals, and often repeatedly interact with many of the same individuals in networks over time. Complex communicative systems, compared with simple communicative systems, are those that contain a large number of structurally and functionally distinct elements or possess a high amount of bits of information.

We discuss social complexity as a driver of communication and possible causal factor in human language origins.

The DSM-IV requires at least five specified symptoms for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe dysphoric form of PMS, while the ICD-10 requires only one distressing symptom for a diagnosis of PMS. Many women who seek treatment fall between these two diagnostic approaches, and standard diagnostic criteria for clinically significant PMS are needed A diagnosis of PMS consists of determining the timing of the symptoms in relation to menses, meaningful change between post- and premenstrual symptom severity and a clinically significant severity of the symptoms. A differential diagnosis to distinguish PMS from other medical and psychiatric conditions is important for appropriate treatment. No hormone or laboratory test indicates a PMS diagnosis. The current diagnostic standard requires confirmation of subjective symptom reports by prospective daily diaries. Diagnostic criteria for PMS must recognize the broad range of symptoms, the temporal pattern of the symptoms and the critical issue of symptom severity, which differentiates clinically significant PMS from normal menstrual cycle changes. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, plasticity in birdsong may partially explain why clades of song learners are more diverse than related clades with innate song. This ``song learning'' hypothesis predicts that (1) differences in song traits evolve faster in song learners, and (2) behavioral discrimination against allopatric song (a proxy for premating reproductive isolation) evolves faster in song learners. We tested these predictions by analyzing acoustic traits and conducting playback experiments in allopatric Central American sister pairs of song learning oscines (N = 42) and nonlearning suboscines (N = 27). We found that nonlearners evolved mean acoustic differences slightly faster than did leaners, and that the mean evolutionary rate of song discrimination was 4.3 times faster in nonlearners than in learners. These unexpected results may be a consequence of significantly greater variability in song traits in song learners (by 54\textendash 79\%) that requires song-learning oscines to evolve greater absolute differences in song before achieving the same level of behavioral song discrimination as nonlearning suboscines. This points to ``a downside of learning'' for the evolution of species discrimination, and represents an important example of plasticity reducing the rate of evolution and diversification by increasing variability.},

We tested this hypothesis by conducting a comparative study of the evolution of bird song, a premating barrier to reproduction. Speciation in birds is typically initiated when geographically isolated (allopatric) populations evolve reproductive barriers. We measured the strength of song as a premating barrier between closely related allopatric populations by conducting 2339 field experiments to measure song discrimination for 175 taxon pairs of allopatric or parapatric New World passerine birds, and estimated recent speciation rates from molecular phylogenies. We found evidence that song discrimination is indeed an important reproductive barrier: taxon pairs with high song discrimination in allopatry did not regularly interbreed in parapatry. However, evolutionary rates of song discrimination were not associated with recent speciation rates. Evolutionary rates of song discrimination were also unrelated to latitude or elevation, but species with innate song (suboscines) evolved song discrimination much faster than species with learned song (oscines). We conclude that song is a key premating reproductive barrier in birds, but faster evolution of this reproductive barrier between populations does not consistently result in faster diversification between species.},

A genome scan of autosomal markers (687 microsatellites and 203 insertions/deletions) on 952 individuals from 41 Pacific populations now provides the basis for understanding the remarkable nature of Melanesian variation, and for a more accurate comparison of these Pacific populations with previously studied groups from other regions. It also shows how textured human population variation can be in particular circumstances. Genetic diversity within individual Pacific populations is shown to be very low, while differentiation among Melanesian groups is high. Melanesian differentiation varies not only between islands, but also by island size and topographical complexity. The greatest distinctions are among the isolated groups in large island interiors, which are also the most internally homogeneous. The pattern loosely tracks language distinctions. Papuan-speaking groups are the most differentiated, and Austronesian or Oceanic-speaking groups, which tend to live along the coastlines, are more intermixed. A small "Austronesian" genetic signature (always {$<$}20\%) was detected in less than half the Melanesian groups that speak Austronesian languages, and is entirely lacking in Papuan-speaking groups. Although the Polynesians are also distinctive, they tend to cluster with Micronesians, Taiwan Aborigines, and East Asians, and not Melanesians. These findings contribute to a resolution to the debates over Polynesian origins and their past interactions with Melanesians. With regard to genetics, the earlier studies had heavily relied on the evidence from single locus mitochondrial DNA or Y chromosome variation. Neither of these provided an unequivocal signal of phylogenetic relations or population intermixture proportions in the Pacific. Our analysis indicates the ancestors of Polynesians moved through Melanesia relatively rapidly and only intermixed to a very modest degree with the indigenous populations there.},

Birds' beaks function not only in foraging but also in thermoregulating and singing, among other behaviours. Studies of beak evolution abound, however, most focus on a single function. Hence,we quantified relative contributions of different functions over an evolutionary timescale. We measured beak shape using geometric morphometrics and compared this trait with foraging behaviour, climatic variables and song characteristics in a phylogenetic comparative study of an Australasian radiation of songbirds (Meliphagidae). We found that both climate and foraging behaviour were significantly correlated with the beak shape and size. However, foraging ecology had a greater effect on shape, and climate had a nearly equal effect on size. We also found that evolutionary changes in beak morphology had significant consequences for vocal performance: Species with elongate-shaped beaks sang at higher frequencies, while species with large beaks sang at a slower pace. The evolution of the avian beak exemplifies how morphological traits can be an evolutionary compromise among functions, and suggests that specialization along any functional axismay increase ecological divergence or reproductive isolation along others.},

Rice hypothesized that such polymorphisms should be relatively common on the X chromosome (or on the W in female-heterogametic species) but relatively rare on the autosomes. Here, I show that there are plausible assumptions under which the reverse is expected to be true, and point out recent studies that give evidence for sexually antagonistic variation on the autosomes. Although more work is needed to resolve the issue, it is premature to conclude that the X chromosome is a "hot spot" for the accumulation of sexually antagonistic variation.},

  abstract = {Individual primates can be identified by the sound of their voice. Macaques have demonstrated an ability to discern conspecific identity from a harmonically structured `coo' call. Voice recognition presumably requires the integrated perception of multiple acoustic features. However, it is unclear how this is achieved, given considerable variability across utterances. Specifically, the extent to which information about caller identity is distributed across multiple features remains elusive. We examined these issues by recording and analysing a large sample of calls from eight macaques. Single acoustic features, including fundamental frequency, duration and Weiner entropy, were informative but unreliable for the statistical classification of caller identity. A combination of multiple features, however, allowed for highly accurate caller identification. A regularized classifier that learned to identify callers from the modulation power spectrum of calls found that specific regions of spectral\textendash temporal modulation were informative for caller identification. These ranges are related to acoustic features such as the call's fundamental frequency and FM sweep direction. We further found that the low-frequency spectrotemporal modulation component contained an indexical cue of the caller body size. Thus, cues for caller identity are distributed across identifiable spectrotemporal components corresponding to laryngeal and supralaryngeal components of vocalizations, and the integration of those cues can enable highly reliable caller identification. Our results demonstrate a clear acoustic basis by which individual macaque vocalizations can be recognized.},

We demonstrate Koe with a real-world case study of New Zealand bellbird Anthornis melanura songs from an archipelago metapopulation. Having classified 21,500 units in Koe, we compare repertoires and sequence structure between sites and sexes. Koe is web-based (koe.io.ac.nz.) and easy to use, making it ideal for collaboration, education and citizen science. By enabling large-scale, high-resolution classification and analysis of animal vocalizations, Koe expands the possibilities for bioacoustics research.},

A pituitary adenoma was diagnosed in 17 patients. A prolactin-cell adenoma was identffied histologically in eight pa-tients. Other etiologic factors were myxedema (two patients), phenothiazlne ingestion (six patients) and breast manipulation (four patients). In 27 patients, including three wtth abnormalttles of the sella turcica, no causal factor was found, and their condition was labelled as dysfunctional in origin. Symptoms were preceded by childbirth in 11 patients and by estrogen-progestin contraception in 22; pituttary adenomas were discovered In both groups in ap-proximately the same frequency (30 per cent) as in the over-all study group. Aside from roentgenographic studies, as well as visual field perimetry in a few cases, a serum prolactin level above 100 ng/ml was the only indicator of a pituitary prolactin-cell adenoma. Pro-lactin-suppression tests (L-DOPA and 2cr-Br-ergocryptlne) were found to be of no value in discriminating between tumoral and dys-functional conditions. No significant alterations in prolactin levels occurred after water loading irrespective of basal levels or the nature of the pathologic process. Selective pituitary tumor excision (eight patients) was followed by rapid normaltzatton of prdactin tevefs and disappearance of clinical abnormalities. Conversely, after pituitary irradiation (eight patients), improvement tended to be slower. Treatment of infertllity in those patients without an apparent organic lesion was more successful wfth Sa-Br-ergocqptlne (three of three) than with clomiphene (two of seven). Pregnancies following the administration of drugs or after surgical treatment were uneventful. Since follow-up resulted in the early diagnosis of pituitary tumors from seven to 56 months after initial investigation, and since no di-agnostic tools are currently available which help to discriminate between tumoral and dysfunctional conditions before abnormalities become evident on roentgenograms, probnged observation of these patients remains essential. 646 May 1977 The Amwkan Journal of Medlclne Vofume 62},

  abstract = {In order to study the neurobiological basis of seasonal changes in hippocampal structure and function, the rate of cell proliferation was examined in male and female wild meadow voles captured during different seasons. We found that the number of [3H]thymidine-labeled cells varied across the seasons and across sex in the meadow vole. Non-breeding female meadow voles had a higher rate of cell proliferation and cell death than males captured during either season or breeding females. These seasonal changes in the female meadow vole were associated with both fluctuating levels of adrenal steroids and gonadal steroids. Estradiol level was highly correlated with both the number of [3H]thymidine-labeled cells and the number of pyknotic cells in female meadow voles, with high levels of estradiol being associated with low levels of cell proliferation and cell death. Corticosterone level was associated with the number of [3H]thymidine-labeled cells in the hilus of female meadow voles. This seasonal change in the number of [3H]thymidine-labeled cells was also related to the overall volume of the hippocampus. At variance with past literature, there was no statistically significant sex difference favoring males in hippocampal volume, although the means were in the predicted direction. In male meadow voles, the number of pyknotic cells was related to testosterone level, with high levels of testosterone being associated with greater levels of cell death in the granular cell layer. There was also a suggestion that the number of [3H]thymidine-labeled cells in the hilus varied seasonally in males, with higher rates of cell proliferation during the breeding season than during the non-breeding season. In summary, we found that there were large fluctuations across the season in the rate of cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of adult female meadow voles. Females captured during the non-breeding season had higher rates of cell proliferation in the granule cell layer than females captured during the breeding season. This seasonal fluctuation was related to hormone levels, with high levels of corticosterone and estradiol being related to lower levels of cell proliferation. These seasonal changes in cell proliferation may be related to known changes in spatial learning in the meadow vole and provide insights into changes in the hippocampus that occur in other species, including primates.}

First, we adjusted field metabolic rate to body size, and calculated the phylogenetic correlation between relative field metabolic rate and measures of song complexity. Second, we compared song complexity of birds inhabiting arid and mesic environments. Conclusion: A measure of short-term song complexity, relative syllable repertoire size, is positively and significantly related to relative field metabolic rate.

Analyses were restricted to a subsample of 2,850 singles (1,497 men, 1,353 women) who had experienced sexual activity in the past 12 months.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants reported their sex/gender, self-identified sexual orientation (heterosexual, gay/lesbian, bisexual), and what percentage of the time they experience orgasm when having sex with a familiar partner.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Mean occurrence rate for experiencing orgasm during sexual activity with a familiar partner was 62.9\% among single women and 85.1\% among single men, which was significantly different (F1,2848 \,=\,370.6, P\,{$<$}\,0.001, {$\eta$}(2) \,=\,0.12). For men, mean occurrence rate of orgasm did not vary by sexual orientation: heterosexual men 85.5\%, gay men 84.7\%, bisexual men 77.6\% (F2,1494 \,=\,2.67, P\,=\,0.07, {$\eta$}(2) \,=\,0.004).

  abstract = {Vocal learning in birds is a complex animal behavior with several parallels to vocal learning in humans. Early experiments in the 70s showing that juvenile birds could learn their species' normal song presented only through loudspeakers led to the general notion that social interactions are unnecessary for song learning. These views were soon challenged, and after decades of research we know that different social factors influence song learning. Here, I discuss recent research that is getting us closer to understanding how. Juvenile birds in the wild are exposed to both direct and indirect interactions with singing adults, which can be relevant to different aspects of the learning process. The exposure to a potential living tutor may trigger or enhance the learning process, but direct interaction with a tutor producing the song type that is finally learned or incorporated to the repertoire is not required. Social interactions that the learner witnesses may be more important in determining which songs are included in the final repertoire of an adult bird. Further research is also required to better understand the role of interactions with females, not by providing a model song to imitate but by exhibiting responses contingent to juveniles practicing their songs.},

However, whether selection for species recognition systematically increases signal diversity during clade radiation remains debated. Here we show that in woodpecker drumming, a rhythmic signal used during mating and territorial defense, the amount of species identity information encoded remained stable during woodpeckers' radiation. Acoustic analyses and evolutionary reconstructions show interchange among six main drumming types despite strong phylogenetic contingencies, suggesting evolutionary tinkering of drumming structure within a constrained acoustic space. Playback experiments and quantification of species discriminability demonstrate sufficient signal differentiation to support species recognition in local communities. Finally, we only find character displacement in the rare cases where sympatric species are also closely related. Overall, our results illustrate how historical contingencies and ecological interactions can promote conservatism in signals during a clade radiation without impairing the effectiveness of information transfer relevant to inter-specific discrimination.},

There are two basic mathematical approaches to group selection: (1) levels of selection, which partitions natural selection into that which owes to differential fitness of individuals within groups and that which owes to differential fitness of groups within the population, and (2) contextual analysis, which partitions natural selection into that which owes to the impact of the individual's phenotype on the individual's fitness and that which owes to the impact of the group's phenotype on the individual's fitness. These are not competing hypotheses, but rather complementary approaches that are appropriate for addressing somewhat different questions.

Cultural~traits can be passed vertically (from parents to offspring), obliquely (from the previous generation via a nonparent model to younger individuals), or horizontally (between unrelated individuals from similar age classes or within generations) [4]. Male humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) have a highly stereotyped, repetitive, and~progressively evolving vocal sexual display or ``song'' [14\textendash 17] that functions in sexual selection (through mate attraction and/or male social sorting) [18\textendash 20]. All males within a population conform to the current version of the display (song type), and similarities may exist among the songs of populations within an ocean basin [16, 17, 21]. Here we present a striking pattern of horizontal transmission: multiple song types spread rapidly and repeatedly in a unidirectional manner, like cultural ripples, eastward through the populations in the western and central South Pacific over an 11-year period.

The songs of humpback whales are one of the most striking examples of the transmission of a cultural trait and social learning in any nonhuman animal. To understand how songs are learned, we investigate rare cases of song hybridization, where parts of an existing song are spliced with a new one, likely before an individual totally adopts the new song. Song unit sequences were extracted from over 9,300 phrases recorded during two song revolutions across the South Pacific Ocean, allowing fine-scale analysis of composition and sequencing. In hybrid songs the current and new songs were spliced together in two specific ways: (i) singers placed a single hybrid phrase, in which content from both songs were combined, between the two song types when transitioning from one to the other, and/or (ii) singers spliced complete themes from the revolutionary song into the current song. Sequence analysis indicated that both processes were governed by structural similarity rules. Hybrid phrases or theme substitutions occurred at points in the songs where both songs contained "similar sounds arranged in a similar pattern." Songs appear to be learned as segments (themes/phrase types), akin to birdsong and human language acquisition, and these can be combined in predictable ways if the underlying structural pattern is similar. These snapshots of song change provide insights into the mechanisms underlying song learning in humpback whales, and comparative perspectives on the evolution of human language and culture.},

  abstract = {Culture, defined as shared behavior or information within a community acquired through some form of social learning from conspecifics, is now suggested to act as a second inheritance system. Cultural processes are important in a wide variety of vertebrate species. Birdsong provides a classic example of cultural processes: cultural transmission, where changes in a shared song are learned from surrounding conspecifics, and cultural evolution, where the patterns of songs change through time. This form of cultural transmission of information has features that are different in speed and form from genetic transmission. More recently, culture, vocal traditions, and an extreme form of song evolution have been documented in cetaceans. Humpback whale song "revolutions," where the single population-wide shared song type is rapidly replaced by a new, novel song type introduced from a neighboring population, represents an extraordinary example of ocean basin-wide cultural transmission rivaled in its geographic extent only by humans. In this review, we examine the cultural evolutions and revolutions present in some birdsong and whale song, respectively. By taking a comparative approach to these cultural processes, we review the existing evidence to understand the similarities and differences for their patterns of expression and the underlying drivers, including anthropogenic influences, which may shape them. Finally, we encourage future studies to explore the role of innovation vs. production errors in song evolution, the fitness information present in song, and how human-induced changes in population sizes, trajectories, and migratory connections facilitating cultural transmission may be driving song revolutions.}

  abstract = {Visual complexity is relevant for many areas ranging from improving usability of technical displays or websites up to understanding aesthetic experiences. Therefore, many attempts have been made to relate objective properties of images to perceived complexity in artworks and other images. It has been argued that visual complexity is a multidimensional construct mainly consisting of two dimensions: A quantitative dimension that increases complexity through number of elements, and a structural dimension representing order negatively related to complexity. The objective of this work is to study human perception of visual complexity utilizing two large independent sets of abstract patterns. A wide range of computational measures of complexity was calculated, further combined using linear models as well as machine learning (random forests), and compared with data from human evaluations. Our results confirm the adequacy of existing two-factor models of perceived visual complexity consisting of a quantitative and a structural factor (in our case mirror symmetry) for both of our stimulus sets. In addition, a non-linear transformation of mirror symmetry giving more influence to small deviations from symmetry greatly increased explained variance. Thus, we again demonstrate the multidimensional nature of human complexity perception and present comprehensive quantitative models of the visual complexity of abstract patterns, which might be useful for future experiments and applications.},

More specifically, two studies based on the Billboard DataSet (Burgoyne, Wild \& Fujinaga, 2011; Burgoyne, 2011), a new corpus presenting transcriptions for more than 700 songs, are presented. The first study looks at the incidence of multi-tonic songs throughout the decade, while the second study focuses on the incidence of flat-side harmonies (e.g. bIII, bVI, and bVII) over the same period of time. While no difference was observed in the frequency of multi-tonic songs, the study showed a significant increase in the incidence of flat-side harmonies during the second half of the decade.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses which include fossils or molecular sequences that are sampled through time require models that allow one sample to be a direct ancestor of another sample. As previously available phylogenetic inference tools assume that all samples are tips, they do not allow for this possibility. We have developed and implemented a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to infer what we call sampled ancestor trees, that is, trees in which sampled individuals can be direct ancestors of other sampled individuals. We use a family of birth-death models where individuals may remain in the tree process after sampling, in particular we extend the birth-death skyline model [Stadler et al., 2013] to sampled ancestor trees. This method allows the detection of sampled ancestors as well as estimation of the probability that an individual will be removed from the process when it is sampled. We show that even if sampled ancestors are not of specific interest in an analysis, failing to account for them leads to significant bias in parameter estimates. We also show that sampled ancestor birth-death models where every sample comes from a different time point are non-identifiable and thus require one parameter to be known in order to infer other parameters. We apply our phylogenetic inference accounting for sampled ancestors to epidemiological data, where the possibility of sampled ancestors enables us to identify individuals that infected other individuals after being sampled and to infer fundamental epidemiological parameters. We also apply the method to infer divergence times and diversification rates when fossils are included along with extant species samples, so that fossilisation events are modelled as a part of the tree branching process. Such modelling has many advantages as argued in the literature. The sampler is available as an open-source BEAST2 package (https://github.com/CompEvol/sampled-ancestors).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND As mortality rates decline, life expectancy increases, and populations age, non-fatal outcomes of diseases and injuries are becoming a larger component of the global burden of disease. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. METHODS We estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data. YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). FINDINGS Globally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57{$\cdot$}6 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 40{$\cdot$}8-75{$\cdot$}9 million [7{$\cdot$}2\%, 6{$\cdot$}0-8{$\cdot$}3]), 45{$\cdot$}1 million (29{$\cdot$}0-62{$\cdot$}8 million [5{$\cdot$}6\%, 4{$\cdot$}0-7{$\cdot$}2]), 36{$\cdot$}3 million (25{$\cdot$}3-50{$\cdot$}9 million [4{$\cdot$}5\%, 3{$\cdot$}8-5{$\cdot$}3]), 34{$\cdot$}7 million (23{$\cdot$}0-49{$\cdot$}6 million [4{$\cdot$}3\%, 3{$\cdot$}5-5{$\cdot$}2]), and 34{$\cdot$}1 million (23{$\cdot$}5-46{$\cdot$}0 million [4{$\cdot$}2\%, 3{$\cdot$}2-5{$\cdot$}3]) of total YLDs, respectively. Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2{$\cdot$}7\% (95\% UI 2{$\cdot$}3-3{$\cdot$}1). Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations. The largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years. Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined were 10{$\cdot$}4\% (95\% UI 9{$\cdot$}0-11{$\cdot$}8) higher in women than in men. Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women. Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence. Globally, we noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality. In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100 000, 95\% UI 6862-11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14 774 YLDs per 100 000, 11 018-19 228). INTERPRETATION The decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates. For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, such as diabetes. As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults. Up-to-date information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate health-system response.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND As mortality rates decline, life expectancy increases, and populations age, non-fatal outcomes of diseases and injuries are becoming a larger component of the global burden of disease. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. METHODS We estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data. YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). FINDINGS Globally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57{$\cdot$}6 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 40{$\cdot$}8-75{$\cdot$}9 million [7{$\cdot$}2\%, 6{$\cdot$}0-8{$\cdot$}3]), 45{$\cdot$}1 million (29{$\cdot$}0-62{$\cdot$}8 million [5{$\cdot$}6\%, 4{$\cdot$}0-7{$\cdot$}2]), 36{$\cdot$}3 million (25{$\cdot$}3-50{$\cdot$}9 million [4{$\cdot$}5\%, 3{$\cdot$}8-5{$\cdot$}3]), 34{$\cdot$}7 million (23{$\cdot$}0-49{$\cdot$}6 million [4{$\cdot$}3\%, 3{$\cdot$}5-5{$\cdot$}2]), and 34{$\cdot$}1 million (23{$\cdot$}5-46{$\cdot$}0 million [4{$\cdot$}2\%, 3{$\cdot$}2-5{$\cdot$}3]) of total YLDs, respectively. Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2{$\cdot$}7\% (95\% UI 2{$\cdot$}3-3{$\cdot$}1). Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations. The largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years. Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined were 10{$\cdot$}4\% (95\% UI 9{$\cdot$}0-11{$\cdot$}8) higher in women than in men. Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women. Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence. Globally, we noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality. In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100\hphantom{,}000, 95\% UI 6862-11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14\hphantom{,}774 YLDs per 100\hphantom{,}000, 11\hphantom{,}018-19\hphantom{,}228). INTERPRETATION The decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates. For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, such as diabetes. As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults. Up-to-date information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate health-system response.

  abstract = {\textbf{Nicole Geberzahn and Sebastien Deregnaucourt}{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$><$}p{$>$}Many species are able to vocally recognise individual conspecifics and such a capacity seems widespread in oscine songbirds. The exact acoustic feature used for such recognition is often not clear. In the zebra finch (\emph{Taeniopygia guttata}), the song motif is composed of few syllables repeated in a fixed sequential order and song bouts include several repetitions of the motif. Here we used an operant discrimination task, the GO/NOGO procedure, to show that zebra finches are capable of vocal individual recognition even if the bird has to distinguish males that all produce an imitation of the same song model. Furthermore, we studied whether such individual vocal recognition was based on spectro-temporal details of song syllables, i.e. the local fine structure of the song, or on the sequential order in which song syllables are arranged in the song bout. To this end, we trained male and female zebra finches to discriminate songs of one male conspecific from those of four others. After learning this baseline discrimination, subjects were exposed to a novel set of stimuli originating from the same individuals, in order to test for their capability to generalise. Subjects correctly classified those novel stimuli illustrating their ability for individual vocal recognition. Then they were exposed to hybrid stimuli combining the syllable sequences of one individual with the spectro-temporal features of another. Behavioural responses of subjects to hybrid stimuli suggest that they rely on spectro-temporal details of syllables and might pay less attention to syllable sequences for individual vocal recognition.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

In most, but not all, species, mated pairs may characteristically combine their songs in a relatively rigid pattern to produce coordinated duet songs. Previous studies disagree on whether duetting or the absence of duetting represented the primitive condition in gibbons. The present study compares singing behaviour in all gibbon species. Various vocal characteristics were subjected to a phylogenetic analysis using previously published phylogenetic trees of the gibbon radiation as a framework. Variables included the degree of sex-specificity of the vocal repertoire, the occurrence of solo songs, and the preference for a specific time of day for song-production. The results suggest the following scenario for the evolution of gibbon songs: (1) The last common ancestor of recent gibbons produced duet songs. (2) Gibbon duets probably evolved from a song which was common to both sexes and which only later became separated into male-specific and female-specific parts (song-splitting theory). (3) A process tentatively called "duet-splitting" is suggested to have led secondarily from a duetting species to a non-duetting species, in that the contributions of the pair-partners split into temporally segregated solo songs. This appears to be the first time that a non-duetting animal can be shown to be derived from a duetting form. (4) The return to exclusive solo singing may be related to the isolated island distribution of the non-duetting species.},

However, the use of dynamic social networks is still limited in this context because it requires long-term social data and new analytical tools. Here, we studied the dynamic evolution of a group of 29 Guinea baboons, {$<$}em{$>$}Papio papio{$<$}/em{$>$}, using a data set of automatically collected cognitive tests comprising more than 16 million records collected over 3 years. We first built a monthly aggregated temporal network describing the baboon's co-presence in the cognitive testing booths. We then used a null model, considering the heterogeneity in the baboons' activity, to define both positive (association) and negative (avoidance) monthly networks. We tested social balance theory by combining these positive and negative social networks. The results showed that the networks were structurally balanced and that newly created edges also tended to preserve social balance. We then investigated several network metrics to gain insights into the individual level and group level social networks' long-term temporal evolution. Interestingly, a measure of similarity between successive monthly networks was able to pinpoint periods of stability and instability and to show how some baboons' ego-networks remained stable while others changed radically. Our study confirms the prediction of social balance theory but also shows that large fluctuations in the numbers of triads may limit its applicability to study the dynamic evolution of animal social networks. In contrast, the use of the similarity measure proved to be very versatile and sensitive in detecting relationships' (in)stabilities at different levels. The changes we identified can be linked, at least in some cases, to females changing primary male, as observed in the wild.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Fueled by sophisticated GIS software and inexpensive and fast computation, collection of data with spatially referenced information has increased. Recognizing that such information can improve data analysis has led to an explosion of modeling and model fitting. The contribution of this paper is to illustrate how Gaussian processes have emerged as, arguably, the most valuable tool in the toolkit for geostatistical modeling. Apart from the simplest versions, geostatistical modeling can be viewed as a hierarchical specification with Gaussian processes introduced appropriately at different levels of the specification. This naturally leads to adopting a Bayesian framework for inference and suitable Gibbs sampling/Markov chain Monte Carlo for model fitting. Here, we review twenty years of modeling work spanning multivariate spatial analysis, gradient analysis, Bayesian nonparametric spatial ideas, directional data, extremes, data fusion, and large spatial and spatio-temporal datasets. We demonstrate that Gaussian processes are the key ingredients in all of this work. Most of the content is focused on modeling with examples being limited due to length constraints for the article. Altogether, we are able to conclude that spatial statistics and Gaussian processes do, indeed, make a beautiful marriage.},

Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the p values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

We used 15O]-H2O positron emission tomography to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 12 healthy women during a nonsexual resting state, clitorally induced orgasm, sexual clitoral stimulation (sexual arousal control) and imitation of orgasm (motor output control). Extracerebral markers of sexual performance and orgasm were rectal pressure variability (RPstd) and perceived level of sexual arousal (PSA). Sexual stimulation of the clitoris (compared to rest) significantly increased rCBF in the left secondary and right dorsal primary somatosensory cortex, providing the first account of neocortical processing of sexual clitoral information. In contrast, orgasm was mainly associated with profound rCBF decreases in the neocortex when compared with the control conditions (clitoral stimulation and imitation of orgasm), particularly in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex, inferior temporal gyrus and anterior temporal pole. Significant positive correlations were found between RPstd and rCBF in the left deep cerebellar nuclei, and between PSA and rCBF in the ventral midbrain and right caudate nucleus. We propose that decreased blood flow in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex signifies behavioural disinhibition during orgasm in women, and that deactivation of the temporal lobe is directly related to high sexual arousal. In addition, the deep cerebellar nuclei may be involved in orgasm-specific muscle contractions while the involvement of the ventral midbrain and right caudate nucleus suggests a role for dopamine in female sexual arousal and orgasm.

Properties were unequivocally classified as static or dynamic based on within-male variability during bouts of calling. Static properties are highly stereotyped within males and between males in natural populations. Dynamic properties often change by as much as 100\% during single bouts of calling; dynamic properties are usually much more variable among males in natural populations than are static properties. An analysis of the calling performance of individual males over the course of a breeding season indicated that at least one dynamic property, pulse number (or call duration) in Hyla versicolor, was sufficiently repeatable to differentiate between males. Playback experiments that employed synthetic calls showed that: (1) females exhibit patterns of preferences that should result in selection that is stabilizing or weakly directional on static properties, and highly directional on dynamic properties; and (2) the overall attractiveness of a signal is affected by variation in both static and dynamic properties. Similar results were found in laboratory and field studies of other taxa, primarily anurans and insects. Patterns of variability in call properties of males and in female preferences are discussed in terms of proximate mechanisms and theoretical models of the evolution of female choice.},

  abstract = {Summary. 1 The breeding biology of Parus major and P. caeruleus was studied in 1947\textendash 49 in a mixed deciduous wood, near Oxford, in which 200 nestboxes were erected (density about two per acre). 2 The combined Great and Blue Tit population rose from about 43 pairs in 1947 (following a very severe winter) to about 100 pairs in 1948, and about 135 pairs in 1949. Of these, nearly all the Great Tits and about two-thirds of the Blue Tits nested in the boxes. 3 Pre-nesting behaviour is briefly described; hole inspecting and courtship feeding were observed. The average time taken to build a nest differed in each season; both species built many more nests than were used for laying. 4 The breeding dates differed by two to three weeks in different years. The exact season is linked to the brief period of abundance of the larvae of Cheimatobia brumata and Hibernia defoliaria, on which the nestlings are largely fed. The seasonal rise and fall in the larval abundance were estimated by measuring the volume of faecal pellets from the larvae. 5 The average clutch-size differed significantly from year to year. Clutches laid early in the season were on average larger than those laid later. Repeat clutches were smaller than first clutches, and genuine second clutches were smaller still. 6 Individual egg-weights of the Great Tit ranged from 1.3 to 2.2 grams, and averaged 1.75 grams (no significant difference between years). Eggs from average-sized clutches were heavier than those from very small or very large clutches. The first four to six eggs laid in a clutch tended to be successively heavier, but in general eggs in each clutch tended to be of similar weight. Clutches of the Blue Tit were weighed in one year only; the average individual egg-weight was 1.11 grams. 7 Incubation tended to begin earlier, in relation to clutch completion, in late nests than in early ones. The mean incubation period of the Great Tit was 13.9 days, and of the Blue Tit 14.2 days. 8 The mean growth rates of Great Tits differed significantly in 1948 and 1949. The growth curve of Blue Tits is similar to that of the Great Tit. 9 Members of large-sized broods averaged significantly lighter than members of small-sized broods, and second-brood nestlings were lighter than first-brood nestlings. Great Tit nestlings aged 14 1/2 days ranged in weight from 10.2 to 21.4 grams. Less than 1\% of the nestlings in first broods died from starvation in the nest, but there were many losses in second broods. 10 Eggs laid after the start of incubation hatched later than the rest of the clutch. Late-hatched nestlings averaged significantly lighter than the others. 11 Frequency of parents' visits to the nest increases with number in brood, but not proportionately. Hence a member of a small-sized brood receives on average more food visits than a member of a large-sized brood. 12 Feather development was independent of body-weight, and is therefore a reliable indicator of age. 13 The mean nestling period of the Great Tit was 18.9 days, of the Blue Tit 19.7 days. 14 When losses due to man are excluded, the breeding success was about 90\% for each species.},

However, recent interest has focused on the consequences of arousing these action tendencies but blocking their execution-that is arresting them. Previous research has shown that depressed people can have strong feelings of anger (fight) and desires to run away (flight), but these 'fight/flight' defences can become blocked, inhibited, and arrested, which increase stress. This study used three clinical focus groups and one of psychiatric nurses to explore depressed people's own ideas of entrapment and arrested anger. Participants felt that arrested escape (entrapments) and arrested anger were important aspects of the experience of depression. Depressed participants clarified distinctions between internal entrapment (feeling trapped in a state of depression), feeling trapped in a subordinate role, and external entrapment (feeling trapped in relationships or life circumstances). Participants also clarified key reasons for arrested anger. Nurses had similar perspectives on the reasons for entrapment in depression but also saw fear of change and opportunities as important sources of entrapment.},

This paper reviews some of the social and non-social theories that seek to explain the potential adaptive advantages of being able to tone down positive affect, and how dysfunctions in such affect control can occur in some contexts. Common to most evolutionary theories of depression is the view that loss of control over aversive events and/or major resources/rewards exert downward pressure on positive affect. Social theories, however, suggest that it is loss of control over the social environment that is particularly depressogenic. Two evolutionary theories (the attachment-loss, and the defeat-loss theories) are briefly reviewed and their interaction considered. It is suggested that phenotypes for toning down positive affect, in the face of loss of control, may become more severe in the context of socially hostile, unsupportive and/or excessively competitive environments. The paper briefly considers how human competencies for self-evaluation in relation to others, rumination, self-criticism, and modern social contexts can accentuate dysfunctional expressions of affect regulation.},

When apparently maladaptive states are widespread, they sometimes confer a hidden advantage, or did so in our evolutionary past. We suggest that PMS had a selective advantage because it increased the chance that infertile pair bonds would dissolve, thus improving the reproductive outcomes of women in such partnerships. We confirm predictions arising from the hypothesis: PMS has high heritability; gene variants associated with PMS can be identified; animosity exhibited during PMS is preferentially directed at current partners; and behaviours exhibited during PMS may increase the chance of finding a new partner. Under this view, the prevalence of PMS might result from genes and behaviours that are adaptive in some societies, but are potentially less appropriate in modern cultures. Understanding this evolutionary mismatch might help depathologize PMS, and suggests solutions, including the choice to use cycle-stopping contraception.},

Within populations, some individuals use social learning more frequently than others, but why social learning phenotypes differ among individuals is poorly understood. We modelled the evolution of social learning frequency in a system where foragers compete for resources, and there are many different foraging options to learn about. Social learning phenotypes diverged when some options offered much better rewards than others and expected rewards changed moderately quickly over time. When options offered similar rewards or when rewards changed slowly, a single social learning phenotype evolved. This held for fixed and simple conditional social learning rules. Sufficiently complex conditional social learning rules prevented the divergence of social learning phenotypes under all conditions. Our results explain how competition can promote the divergence of social learning phenotypes.}

We asked singers to perform an unaccompanied song from memory following deliberate learning and memorization of the words and melody separately and together. Participants with high levels of musical expertise gave more accurate and fluent performances than those with lower levels of musical expertise, but only when they had memorized the words and melody together. While some errors were conjoint, such that erroneous recall of one component \textendash{} words or melody \textendash{} affected recall for the other, a higher proportion were separate, such that participants were able to preserve one component when they recalled the other erroneously. Words and melody are thus recalled in association with one another, so that retrieving one enables retrieval of the other, but are not integrated to the extent that failure to recall one accurately invariably results in failure to recall the other. Finally, more hesitations were made at the ends of phrases than at the start or mid-phrase, suggesting that the formal structure of a song provides a framework for recall. In conclusion, memorizing words and melody together is an effective strategy, but perhaps only for singers with high levels of musical expertise.},

We challenge this assumption by exploring hypothetical scenarios where the use of such information either provides no benefit or can actually be costly. First, we show that the level of incompatibility between the acquisition of personal and socially acquired information will directly affect the extent to which the use of socially acquired information can be profitable. When these two sources of information cannot be acquired simultaneously, there may be no benefit to socially acquired information. Second, we assume that a solitary individual's behavioural decisions will be based on cues revealed by its own interactions with the environment. However, in many cases, for social animals the only socially acquired information available to individuals is the behavioural actions of others that expose their decisions, rather than the cues on which these decisions were based. We argue that in such a situation the use of socially acquired information can lead to informational cascades that sometimes result in sub-optimal behaviour. From this theory of informational cascades, we predict that when erroneous cascades are costly, individuals should pay attention only to socially generated cues and not behavioural decisions. We suggest three scenarios that might be examples of informational cascades in nature.},

We measured performance in an orientation-estimation task and found that orientation judgments were more accurate at cardinal (horizontal and vertical) orientations. Judgments made under conditions of uncertainty were strongly biased toward cardinal orientations. We estimated observers' internal models for orientation and found that they matched the local orientation distribution measured in photographs.

The cave's abundant images represent one of the most stunning examples of European Upper Palaeolithic cave art and, in terms of the material provisioning of the cave, demonstrable artistic skill, and difficulties accessing decorated areas, it represented a huge cost to its hunter-gatherer creators. But does it represent group cost or can any CST element be identified? We approach this question using several characteristics we regard as central to costly signalling, and explore the various ways by which this occurred within the cave.

We provide an open-source and quantitative workflow for estimating rates of origination, extinction, and preservation, as well as identifying key shift points in the diversification histories of material culture. We demonstrate our approach using two distinct kinds of data: age ranges for the production of American car models, and radiocarbon dates associated with archaeological cultures of the European Neolithic. Our approach improves on existing frameworks by disentangling the relative contributions of origination and extinction to diversification. Our method also permits rigorous statistical testing of competing hypotheses to explain changes in diversity. Finally, we stress the value of a flexible approach that can be applied to data in various forms; this flexibility allows scholars to explore commonalities between forms of material culture and ask questions about the general properties of cultural change.}

These attributes can reduce the costs leaders incur and increase the efficacy of leadership. Leadership becomes more institutional in domains of collective action, such as resolution of intragroup conflict, where collective action failure threatens group integrity.

Here, by contrast, we apply the variational autoencoder (VAE), an unsupervised learning method, to learn features directly from data and quantify the vocal behavior of two model species: the laboratory mouse and the zebra finch. The VAE converges on a parsimonious representation that outperforms handpicked features on a variety of common analysis tasks, enables the measurement of moment-by-moment vocal variability on the timescale of tens of milliseconds in the zebra finch, provides strong evidence that mouse ultrasonic vocalizations do not cluster as is commonly believed, and captures the similarity of tutor and pupil birdsong with qualitatively higher fidelity than previous approaches. In all, we demonstrate the utility of modern unsupervised learning approaches to the quantification of complex and high-dimensional vocal behavior.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Environmental instability (i.e. environments changing often) can select fixed phenotypes because of the lag time of plastically adapting to environmental changes, known as the lag-time constraint. Because behaviour can change rapidly (e.g. switching between foraging strategies), the lag-time constraint is not considered important for behavioural plasticity. Instead, it is often argued that responsive behaviour (i.e. behaviour that changes according to the environment) evolves to cope with unstable environments. But proficiently performing certain behaviours may require time for learning, for practising or, in social animals, for the group to adjust to one's behaviour. Conversely, not using certain behaviours for a period of time can reduce their level of performance. Here, using individual-based evolutionary simulations, we show that environmental instability selects for fixed behaviour when the ratio between the rates of increase and reduction in behavioural performance is below a certain threshold; only above this threshold does responsive behaviour evolve in unstable environments. Thus, the lag-time constraint can apply to behaviours that attain high performance either slowly or rapidly, depending on the relative rate with which their performance decreases when not used. We discuss these results in the context of the evolution of reduced behavioural plasticity, as seen in fixed personality differences.}

In this study, Spanish-speaking Ecuadorian children learned a novel English passage for 2 weeks. Children in a sung condition learned the passage as a song and children in the spoken condition learned the passage as an oral poem. Children were tested on their ability to recall the passage verbatim, pronounce English vowel sounds, and translate target terms from English to Spanish. As predicted, children in the sung condition outperformed children in the spoken condition in all three domains. The song advantage persevered after a 6-month delay.

  abstract = {Through simulation studies and genomic data analysis, researchers have shown that modularity in metabolic networks is an important adaptive mechanism enabling survival in changing environments. Another global property of networks, flow hierarchy, is often used in optimizing information flow in designed networks. Hierarchy also arises in self-organized networks as an optimal way to aggregate flows while minimizing costs of connections. Using a comparative approach on 2,935 bacterial metabolic networks, we show that hierarchy evolves with modularity and is conserved to a high degree. Hierarchy in bacterial metabolic networks reflects a fundamental tradeoff between growth rate and biomass production, and reflects a bacteria's realized ecological strategy. Additionally, by inferring the ancestral metabolic networks, we find that hierarchy decreases with distance from the root of the tree, suggesting the important pressure of increased growth rate relative to efficiency in the face of competition. Just as hierarchical character is an important structural property in efficiently engineered systems, we see that it evolves in self-organized bacterial metabolic networks, is reflective of the life-history strategy of the bacteria, and plays an important role in network organization and efficiency.},

Less a? ention has been paid to the fe- males' behavior and to communication between members of a pair. In Great Tits (Parus major), males sing vigorously at dawn in the vicinity of the female's nest hole just before and during egg laying. We studied the female's vocal behavior during the dawn chorus as well as commu- nication between pair members. All females vocally interacted with their mates from inside the nest box. Females produced a sound with a very low sound-pressure level only audible from few meters, which we have named the ``quiet call.'' This quiet call was unique to females and was only produced from inside the nest box. To our knowledge, our study is the fi rst to show that both members of a pair vocally interact during the dawn chorus. Given that many temper- ate-zone bird species have similar life histories as the Great Tit, it is very likely that similar interactive behavior occurs in other (song)birds. This interactive behavior may provide a new and manipulable tool for testing hypotheses about the dawn song and can be used as a future bioassay of male vocalizations},

However, raising a brood together requires successful communication between both members of a pair. By placing small microphones inside the nesting cavity of great and blue tits, we were able to record several novel female sounds that have not been described previously. These recordings also provided evidence of vocal interactions between the female inside and the male outside the nest hole. Females produced on average 2.7 different vocalisation categories during each recording session, ranging from one to seven. With only one exception, all females used the same vocalisation type when vocally interacting with their mate. The acoustical properties of these sounds suggest that they are designed for short range communication and sonographic representation revealed remarkable similarities in the vocal signals of blue and great tit females. We discuss the possible functions and selection pressures shaping female vocal signals and we provide a possible mechanism promoting vocal mimicry in blue tits. We present a recording approach that might help studying short range communication and vocal behaviour in female (song)birds which are otherwise difficult to observe.},

However, frequent interactions of songbirds with heterospecifics may necessitate adequate communication outside the species boundary. In this study, we focus on heterospecific communication behaviour of two small sympatric congeneric passerines, great and blue tits (Parus major and Parus caeruleus), which breed in overlapping territories and compete for food and nesting cavities. By means of a first playback experiment, we show that (1) heterospecific matching (imitating songs of the other species) is a strategy frequently used by great tits but not by blue tits, (2) both blue tit trilled and untrilled song can be accurately matched by great tits and that (3) almost half of the great tits in our study population match at least one blue tit song across all studied breeding stages, indicating that this heterospecific matching behaviour is a common feature in this population. A second playback experiment showed that these great tit imitations of blue tit songs do not function in intraspecific communication between male great tits. Hence, these heterospecific imitations appear to be designed for interspecific communication with blue tits. These findings suggest a strong heterospecific influence on the vocal learning process, repertoire composition and repertoire use in great tits and provide a possible mechanism that can drive song convergence in songbirds.},

We have tested the responses of LIP neurons to stimuli that entered their receptive field by saccades. Neurons had little or no response to stimuli brought into their receptive field by saccades, unless the stimuli were behaviourally significant. We established behavioural significance in two ways: either by making a stable stimulus task-relevant, or by taking advantage of the attentional attraction of an abruptly appearing stimulus. Our results show that under ordinary circumstances the entire visual world is only weakly represented in LIP. The visual representation in LIP is sparse, with only the most salient or behaviourally relevant objects being strongly represented.},

It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an oragnism into unitary 'traits' and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with Baupl\"ane so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures.

Dispersal influences the genetic structure of populations as well as geographic variation in phenotypic traits. Patterns of spatial genetic structure and geographic variation may vary between the sexes whenever males and females exhibit different dispersal behaviors. Here, we examine dispersal, spatial genetic structure, and spatial acoustic structure in Rufous-and-white Wrens, a year-round resident tropical bird. Both sexes sing in this species, allowing us to compare acoustic variation between males and females and examine the relationship between dispersal and song sharing for both sexes. Using a long-term dataset collected over an 11-year period, we used banding data and molecular genetic analyses to quantify natal and breeding dispersal distance in Rufous-and-white Wrens. We quantified song sharing and examined whether sharing varied with dispersal distance, for both males and females. Observational data and molecular genetic analyses indicate that dispersal is female-biased. Females dispersed farther from natal territories than males, and more often between breeding territories than males. Furthermore, females showed no significant spatial genetic structure, consistent with expectations, whereas males showed significant spatial genetic structure. Overall, natal dispersal appears to have more influence than breeding dispersal on spatial genetic structure and spatial acoustic structure, given that the majority of breeding dispersal events resulted in individuals moving only short distances. Song sharing between pairs of same-sex animals decreases with the distance between their territories for both males and females, although males exhibited significantly greater song sharing than females. Lastly, we measured the relationship between natal dispersal distance and song sharing. We found that sons shared fewer songs with their fathers the farther they dispersed from their natal territories, but that song sharing between daughters and mothers was not significantly correlated with natal dispersal distance. Our results reveal cultural differences between the sexes, suggesting a relationship between culture and sex-biased dispersal.},

  abstract = {A fundamental hypothesis about vocal learning is that young animals learn vocalizations in their natal areas and, following postnatal dispersal, they may introduce new types of vocalizations into their breeding areas. We tested this hypothesis in a tropical bird, the Rufous-and-white Wren (Thryophilus rufalbus), a species in which both sexes produce learned songs. We collected blood samples and acoustic recordings from 146 adult wrens from 3 populations in northwestern Costa Rica. We genotyped individuals at 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci and identified first-generation migrants using partial Bayesian genotype assignment. We quantified acoustic variation by comparing fine-scale acoustic structure, song sharing, and repertoire novelty between residents and first-generation migrants. We found significant population-level differences in acoustic structure of songs among the 3 populations. Of the 146 individuals genotyped, 9 individuals were identified as first-generation migrants. In contrast to our predictions, however, we found that these first-generation migrants did not exhibit differences in the acoustic structure of their songs from resident individuals in their breeding population, either for males or females. We conclude that song learning in first-generation migrants must be behaviorally influenced by birds in their breeding populations, following postnatal dispersal. We observed population-level acoustic differences among the 3 study sites, which implies sustained divergent selection pressures at each site, possibly reflecting acoustic adaptation to different environments or social pressure to sing local songs. Understanding and quantifying patterns of cultural evolution at multiple scales provides insight into how behavioral barriers, such as acoustic signals, contribute to population differentiation and even speciation.},

  abstract = {Consideration of the possibilities and difficulties of detecting character displacement leads to a re-definition of the phenomenon; character displacement is the process by which a morphological character state of a species changes under Natural Selection arising from the presence, in the same environment, of one or more species similar to it ecologically and/or reproductively. This incorporates the principal ideas in the original definition given by Brown \& Wilson (1956), but eliminates the restriction of making comparisons of the character states of a species in sympatry and allopatry. The evidence for the ecological (competitive) aspect of character displacement is assessed by analyzing in detail the best documented and well publicized examples in the literature. Some of the examples either do not exhibit displaced characters or, if they do, the ``displacement'' can be interpreted in other and perhaps simpler ways; this applies to the so-called classical case of character displacement, Sitta tephronota and S. neumayer in Iran. Other examples, involving lizards and birds, constitute better evidence for character displacement, but in no single study is it entirely satisfactory. It is concluded that the evidence for the ecological aspect of character displacement is weak. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1972, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

  abstract = {Songs of Darwin's finches were studied on the Galapagos Island of Daphne Major from 1976 to 1995. A single, structurally simple, and unvarying song is sung throughout life by each male of the two common species, Geospiza fortis (medium ground finch) and G. scandens (cactus finch). Songs of the two species differ strongly in quantitative features, and individual variation among males is much broader in G. fortis than in G. scandens. Although there are exceptions, songs of sons strongly resemble the songs of their fathers. They also resemble the songs of their paternal grandfathers, but not their maternal grandfathers, indicating that they are culturally inherited and not genetically inherited. Female G. fortis display a tendency to avoid mating with males that sing the same type of song as their father. They also avoid mating with males that sing heterospecific song, with very rare exceptions. Thus song, an evolving, culturally inherited trait, is an important factor in species recognition and mate choice. It constrains the mating of females to conspecifics, even when there is no genetic penalty to interbreeding, and thus may play a crucial role in species formation by promoting genetic isolation on secondary contact. The barrier is leaky in that occasional errors in song transmission result in misimprinting, which leads to a low incidence of hybridization and introgression. Introgression slows the rate of postzygotic isolation, but can produce individuals in novel genetic and morphological space that can provide the starting point of a new evolutionary trajectory.},

  abstract = {External (environmental) factors affecting the speciation of birds are better known than the internal (genetic) factors. The opposite is true for several groups of invertebrates, Drosophila being the outstanding example. Ideas about the genetics of speciation in general trace back to Dobzhansky who worked with Drosophila. These ideas are an insufficient guide for reconstructing speciation in birds for two main reasons. First, speciation in birds proceeds with the evolution of behavioral barriers to interbreeding; postmating isolation usually evolves much later, perhaps after gene exchange has all but ceased. As a consequence of the slow evolution of postmating isolating factors the scope for reinforcement of premating isolation is small, whereas the opportunity for introgressive hybridization to influence the evolution of diverging species is large. Second, premating isolation may arise from nongenetic, cultural causes; isolation may be affected partly by song, a trait that is culturally inherited through an imprinting-like process in many, but not all, groups of birds. Thus the genetic basis to the origin of bird species is to be sought in the inheritance of adult traits that are subject to natural and sexual selection. Some of the factors involved in premating isolation (plumage, morphology, and behavior) are under single- gene control, most are under polygenic control. The genetic basis of the origin of postmating isolating factors affecting the early development of embryos (viability) and reproductive physiology (sterility) is almost completely unknown. Bird speciation is facilitated by small population size, involves few genetic changes, and occurs relatively rapidly.},

Species are not static but can shift in acoustic and morphological space, yet maintain their distinctiveness. Investigating such a situation in a community of Darwin's finches sheds light on the origin and maintenance of premating barriers between species. Explanations for songs divergence generally invoke morphological changes to the sound-producing apparatus, environmental changes influencing transmitting properties of song, avoidance of acoustical interference with other species, and random processes including copying errors. We investigated changes in songs of Geospiza fortis (medium ground finch) and Geospiza scandens (cactus ground finch) from 1978 to 2010 on Daphne Major Island, Gal\'apagos. The habitat did not change significantly; however, the finch community changed. The socially aggressive congener Geospiza magnirostris (large ground finch), singing in the same frequency band (2-4 kHz), colonized Daphne in 1983 and increased in numbers. Temporal features of the songs of G. fortis and G. scandens, especially trill rate and song duration, diverged from G. magnirostris songs as it became increasingly common. Changes in song were not a passive consequence of a change in beak morphology. Instead they arose as a bias during song imprinting and production. Sons of both G. fortis and G. scandens sang faster songs than their respective fathers and thereby differed more from G. magnirostris in their songs than did their fathers. Divergence from an aversive or confusing stimulus during learning illustrates a "peak shift" that may be a common feature of song evolution and speciation.},

Sex-chromosome abnormalities are frequent and give rise to two well-defined syndromes, Turner and Klinefelter syndromes, and other less well-defined syndromes such as 47,XXX and 47,XYY syndromes and other conditions with mosaicism, translocations or additional sex chromosomes. The genetic background for these syndromes is incompletely understood, and only one gene on the sex chromosomes, the \{SHOX\} gene, has been unequivocally linked with the syndromes. Other genes are expected to play a role in the different phenotypes presented by the syndromes and await discovery. All syndromes are characterized by delay in diagnosis or even nondiagnosis, increased mortality to a host of different causes, increased morbidity, neurocognitive deficits, but either normal or slightly reduced intelligence quotient. Most females with Turner syndrome do well in society while existing data suggest that persons with Klinefelter, 47,XXX and 47,XYY syndromes do less well. Late diagnosis often leads to postponement of appropriate treatment and diagnosis of complicating traits or disease, such as cardiovascular problems, which could lead to premature death. Specific health issues relate to the individual syndromes, which necessitate a multidisciplinary approach, often including clinical genetics, pediatrics, cardiology, endocrinology, psychology, ENT, and other specialties, adopting a cradle-to-grave philosophy in order to fully envelope the different syndromes.},

In this paper we argue that meme-like inheritance is not a necessary requirement for descent with modification. We suggest that an alternative and more productive way of Darwinizing culture can be found in the application of phylogenetic methods. We review recent work on cultural phylogenetics and outline six fundamental questions that can be answered using the power and precision of quantitative phylogenetic methods. However, cultural evolution, like biological evolution, is often far from tree-like. We discuss the problems reticulate evolution can cause for phylogenetic analyses and suggest ways in which these problems can be overcome. Our solutions involve a combination of new methods for the study of cultural evolution (network construction, reconciliation analysis, and Bayesian mixture models), and the triangulation of different lines of historical evidence. Throughout we emphasize that most debates about cultural phylogenies can only be settled by empirical research rather than armchair speculation.},

  abstract = {(1) Natal dispersal in the great tit in Wytham Wood has been examined from data collected during 1964-75. A large proportion of individuals breed close to where they were born. Females disperse more than males. The median distance of dispersal from birth to first breeding site is 558 m for males and 879 m for females. The modal number of territories moved is 1-2 in males, 2-3 in females. (2) Males that are recorded as breeding for the first time in their second year do not disperse further from their natal site than those males known to have bred in the wood in both their first and second years. (3) There are marked annual fluctuations in dispersal in males and females. Dispersal is related to population density in both sexes, negatively with distance in females, positively with the number of territories moved in males. There is less variation among females than males in the median number of territories moved each year. First year males are more likely to occupy part of their natal territory if their father died in the preceding year than if he survived. It is suggested that competition for territories is greater among males than females and that eventual natal dispersal is determined more during the time of territory establishment in the first year of breeding than during the period of post-fledgling dispersal the preceding autumn. (4) Dispersal distance in females is not related to the age or status of their mate. In males, those moving particularly long or short distances are more likely to pair with an older rather than a first year female. Although older females have a higher reproductive success than first years (Perrins \& Moss 1974) we were unable to detect an equivalent advantage to those males at either end of the dispersal distribution. This may have been due to a relatively small sample size. (5) Absolute dispersal or deviations from median dispersal are not related in either sex to laying date, clutch size or number of fledglings. However those females dispersing more than the median distance are more likely to raise offspring that subsequently breed in the wood. There is a shortage of females raising one such offspring in those moving less than the median distance. (6) The probability of predation or desertion is not affected by dispersal. Likewise the rate of mortality within the wood is similar at all distances from the nestbox of birth. (7) The natal dispersal of offspring is similar to that of their parents. The estimated heritability of dispersal is 56-62\%.},

Maintaining social associations is particularly important in cooperative breeders, yet vocal learning in such species has only been assessed in systems where social association was correlated with relatedness. Thus, benefits of vocal learning as a means of maintaining social associations could not be disentangled from benefits of kin recognition. We assessed genetic and cultural contributions to song in a species where social association was not strongly correlated with kinship: the cooperatively breeding, reproductively promiscuous splendid fairy-wren (Malurus splendens). We found that song characters of socially associated father-son pairs were more strongly correlated (and thus songs were more similar) than songs of father-son pairs with a genetic, but no social, association (i.e. cuckolding fathers). Song transmission was, therefore, vertical and cultural, with minimal signatures of kinship. Additionally, song characters were not correlated with several phenotypic indicators of male quality, supporting the idea that there may be a tradeoff between accurate copying of tutors and quality signalling via maximizing song performance, particularly when social and genetic relationships are decoupled. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that song learning facilitates the maintenance of social associations by permitting unrelated individuals to acquire similar signal phenotypes. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Royal Society.},

  abstract = {Languages are transmitted from person to person and generation to generation via a process of iterated learning: people learn a language from other people who once learned that language themselves. We analyze the consequences of iterated learning for learning algorithms based on the principles of Bayesian inference, assuming that learners compute a posterior distribution over languages by combining a prior (representing their inductive biases) with the evidence provided by linguistic data. We show that when learners sample languages from this posterior distribution, iterated learning converges to a distribution over languages that is determined entirely by the prior. Under these conditions, iterated learning is a form of Gibbs sampling, a widely-used Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The consequences of iterated learning are more complicated when learners choose the language with maximum posterior probability, being affected by both the prior of the learners and the amount of information transmitted between generations. We show that in this case, iterated learning corresponds to another statistical inference algorithm, a variant of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. These results clarify the role of iterated learning in explanations of linguistic universals and provide a formal connection between constraints on language acquisition and the languages that come to be spoken, suggesting that information transmitted via iterated learning will ultimately come to mirror the minds of the learners.},

The idea behind this method is simple: This article uses the responses produced by a participant on one trial to generate the stimuli that either they or another participant will see on the next. A formal analysis of this "iterated learning" procedure, based on the assumption that the learners are Bayesian agents, predicts that it should reveal the inductive biases of these learners, as expressed in a prior probability distribution over hypotheses. This article presents a series of experiments using stimuli based on a well-studied set of category structures, demonstrating that iterated learning can be used to reveal the inductive biases of human learners.},

We address this question through a detailed investigation of transmission chains, in which each person passes information to another along a chain. We review mathematical and empirical evidence that shows that under general conditions, and across experimental paradigms, the information passed along transmission chains will be affected by the inductive biases of the people involved-the constraints on learning and memory, which influence conclusions from limited data. The mathematical analysis considers the case where each person is a rational Bayesian agent. The empirical work consists of behavioural experiments in which human participants are shown to operate in the manner predicted by the Bayesian framework. Specifically, in situations in which each person's response is used to determine the data seen by the next person, people converge on concepts consistent with their inductive biases irrespective of the information seen by the first member of the chain. We then relate the Bayesian analysis of transmission chains to models of biological evolution, clarifying how chains of individuals correspond to population-level models and how selective forces can be incorporated into our models. Taken together, these results indicate how laboratory studies of transmission chains can provide information about the dynamics of cultural evolution and illustrate that inductive biases can have a significant impact on these dynamics.},

We also describe a custom pipeline for genotype inference to mitigate biases from heterogeneous sequencing technologies and coverage levels. Our analysis indicates that the San population of southern Africa diverged from other human populations approximately 108-157 thousand years ago, that Eurasians diverged from an ancestral African population 38-64 thousand years ago, and that the effective population size of the ancestors of all modern humans was {$\sim$}9,000.},

  abstract = {X and Y chromosomal variations including tetrasomy and pentasomy conditions are rare and occur in 1:18,000-1:100,000 male births. The most common sex chromosome aneuploidy is 47, XXY for which there is a rich literature delineating the physical and neurobehavioral phenotype. Although the more complex chromosome aneuploidies 48, XXYY, 48, XXXY, and 49, XXXXY are often compared with 47, XXY (Klinefelter syndrome) because of shared features including tall stature and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, there is a wider spectrum of physical and cognitive abilities that have recently been delineated. The phenotypic presentation of the boys with more severe aneuploidy shares some characteristics with 47, XXY, but there are also other unique and distinctive features. Previously unappreciated intact nonverbal skills have been demonstrated in association with severe developmental dyspraxia. MRI findings of white matter hyperintensities may underlie cognitive deficits and deserve further study. This report discusses what is known about clinical variability in the XY syndromes collectively evaluated through careful multidisciplinary clinical evaluation including the clinical and neurobehavioral aspects of these conditions. Variability in clinical and cognitive functioning may reflect skewed X inactivation, mosaicism, or epigenetic factors that warrant further investigation.},

  abstract = {Understanding communication and signalling has long been strived for in studies of animal behaviour. Many songbirds have a variable and complex song, closely connected to territory defence and reproductive success. However, the quantification of such variable song is challenging. In this paper, we present a novel, automated method for detection and classification of syllables in birdsong. The method provides a tool for pairwise comparison of syllables with the aim of grouping them in terms of their similarity. This allows analyses such as (1) determining repertoire size within an individual, (2) comparing song similarity between individuals within as well as between populations of a species and (3) comparing songs of different species (e.g. for species recognition). Our method is based on a particular feature representation of song units (syllables) which ensures invariance to shifts in time, frequency and amplitude. Using a single song from a great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, recorded in the wild, the proposed algorithm is evaluated by means of comparison to manual auditory and visual (spectrogram) song investigation by a human expert and to standard song analysis methods. Our birdsong analysis approach conforms well to manual classification and, moreover, outperforms the hitherto widely used methods based on mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and spectrogram cross-correlation. Thus, our algorithm is a methodological step forward for analyses of song (syllable) repertoires of birds singing with high complexity.},

Despite its importance, few osteometric studies of the foramen magnum have been published so far. A total of 110 transverse and 111 sagittal diameters from Central European male and female dry specimens dating from the Pleistocene to modern times were measured, and related to sex, age, stature, ethnicity, and a possible secular trend. Only a moderate positive correlation between the transverse and the sagittal diameter of the foramen magnum was found. Surprisingly, neither sexual dimorphism, individual age-dependency, nor a secular trend was found for either diameter. Furthermore, the relationship between the individual stature and foramen magnum diameters was weak: thus foramen magnum size cannot be used as reliable indicator for stature estimation. Further consideration of possible factors influencing the variability of human foramen magnum size shall be explored in larger and geographically more diverse samples, thus serving forensic, clinical, anatomical, and anthropological interests in this body part.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous formation of locally ordered patterns during dewetting of thin films on homogeneous and heterogeneous substrates is investigated based on the 3-D nonlinear equation of motion. Physicochemical heterogeneities engender the rapid formation of the primary holes that serve as "seeds" for the formation of locally ordered structures. The secondary multiring structure surrounding the primary hole evolves by one of the following two different pathways depending on the film thickness vis-\`a-vis the location of the minimum in the spinodal curve: (A) Thick films evolve by the formation of secondary satellite holes that originate from a ring-like depression behind the rim of the primary hole. The process of ordering is repeated until the true spinodal holes appear on the remaining substrate. (B) Ordering in a relatively thin film occurs by the formation of droplets caused by the disintegration of the elevated rim that surrounds the primary hole. The radial distance between the successive ordered layers is close to the spinodal length scale, lambda(m). Droplets within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly greater than lambda(m), whereas holes within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly less than lambda(m). The number density of holes or droplets in the ordered pattern is of the same order as the predictions of the spinodal theory. The number of ordered layers and the size of the locally ordered domain depend significantly on the relative magnitudes of the time scales for the following events: (1) formation of the primary hole, (2) growth of holes (inverse of hole-growth velocity), (3) formation of a secondary feature (hole or droplet) adjacent to the primary hole, (4) true spinodal rupture far from the primary hole. The morphology of an ordered structure can therefore be tailored by modulation of the film thickness and the short- and long-range intermolecular interactions (substrate surface properties), since these affect the time scales 1 to 4 in different ways.},

We show that contrarily to a widely shared belief, partial Mantel tests are not valid in this case, and their bias remains close to that of the simple Mantel test. We confirm that strong biases are expected under a sampling design and spatial correlation parameter drawn from an actual study. The Mantel tests should not be used in case auto-correlation is suspected in both variables compared under the null hypothesis. We outline alternative strategies.

Previous studies of human skull morphology found levels of among-population differentiation that were comparable to those of neutral genetic markers, suggesting that genetic drift (neutral processes) played an important role in influencing facial differentiation. However, variation in soft-tissue morphology has not been studied in detail. In this study, we analyzed high-resolution 3D images of soft-tissue facial form in four Eurasian populations: Han Chinese, Tibetans, Uyghur and Europeans. A novel method was used to establish a high-density alignment across all of the faces, allowing facial diversity to be examined at an unprecedented resolution. These data exhibit signatures of population structure and history. However, among-population differentiation was higher for soft-tissue facial form than for genome-wide genetic loci, and high-resolution analyses reveal that the nose, brow area and cheekbones exhibit particularly strong signals of differentiation (Qstestimates: 0.3-0.8) between Europeans and Han Chinese. Our results suggest that local adaptation and/or sexual selection have been important in shaping human soft-tissue facial morphology.},

Volitional control of vocal utterances is one such indispensable feature of language. We investigated the ability of two monkeys to volitionally utter species-specific calls over many years. Both monkeys reliably vocalized on command during juvenile periods, but discontinued this controlled vocal behavior in adulthood. This emerging disability was confined to volitional vocal production, as the monkeys continued to vocalize spontaneously. In addition, they continued to use hand movements as instructed responses during adulthood. This greater vocal flexibility of monkeys early in ontogeny supports the neoteny hypothesis in human evolution. This suggests that linguistic capabilities were enabled via an expansion of the juvenile period during the development of humans.},

Major depression is characterized by additional symptoms\textemdash such as loss of interest in virtually all activities and suicidality \textemdash{} that have no obvious utility. The frequent association of these severe and disabling symptoms with apparently functional symptoms, like sadness and low mood, challenges both dysfunctional and functional accounts of depression. Given that the principal cause of major unipolar depression is a significant negative life event, and that its characteristic symptom is a loss of interest in virtually all activities, it is possible that this syndrome functions somewhat like a labor strike. When powerful others are benefiting from an individual's efforts, but the individual herself is not benefiting, she can, by reducing her productivity, put her value to them at risk to compel their consent and assistance in renegotiating the social contract so that it will yield net fitness benefits for her. In partial support of this hypothesis, depression is associated with the receipt of considerable social benefits despite the negative reaction it causes in others.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women are twice as likely as men to be depressed, a bias that is poorly understood. One evolutionary model proposes that depression is a bargaining strategy to compel reluctant social partners to provide more help in the wake of adversity. An evolutionary model of anger proposes that high upper body strength predisposes individuals to angrily threaten social partners who offer too few benefits or impose too many costs. Here, we propose that when social partners provide too few benefits or impose too many costs, the physically strong become overtly angry and the physically weak become depressed. The sexual dimorphism in upper body strength means that men will be more likely to bargain with anger and physical threats and women with depression. METHODOLOGY: We tested this idea using the 2011-12 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a large nationally representative sample of US households that included measures of depression and upper body strength. RESULTS: A 2 SD increase in grip strength decreased the odds of depression by more than half ([Formula: see text],[Formula: see text]), which did not appear to be a consequence of confounds with anthropometric, hormonal or socioeconomic variables, but was partially explained by a confound with physical disability. Nevertheless, upper body strength mediated 63\% of the effect of sex on depression, but the mediation effect was unexpectedly moderated by age. CONCLUSIONS: Low upper body strength is a risk factor for depression, especially in older adults, and the sex difference in body strength appears to explain much of the perplexing sex difference in depression.},

Using genetic silencing of cortical activity starting before the formation of orientation selectivity, we found that the orientation selectivity of neurons in the mouse visual cortex formed and matured normally despite a strong suppression of both spontaneous and visually evoked activity throughout development. After the orientation selectivity formed, the distribution of the preferred orientations of neurons was reorganized. We found that this process required spontaneous activity, but not visually evoked activity. Thus, the initial formation and maturation of orientation selectivity is largely independent of neuronal activity, and the initial selectivity is subsequently modified depending on neuronal activity.},

In the current study, we used an operant discrimination task to examine whether birds classify the songs produced by males in these two previously studied locations as belonging to distinct open-ended categories. In both experiments, when birds were presented with new songs, they continued to respond to songs from the same geographical location as the songs that were reinforced during initial discrimination training, suggesting that birds were using open-ended categorization. We also presented birds with songs in which we manipulated acoustic features in order to examine the acoustic mechanisms used during discrimination; results provide support that birds use the duration of the song when discriminating, but the results also suggest that birds used additional acoustic features. Taken together, these experiments show that black-capped chickadees classify songs into open-ended, geography-based categories, and provide compelling evidence that perceptible acoustic differences exist in a vocalization that is seemingly consistent across the species' range.},

However, as researchers in the field of animal behaviour have become more diverse, women have made substantial contributions to the birdsong literature, including through the study of female birdsong. We investigated the influence of gender on research topic and asked: are research articles on female birdsong disproportionately authored by women? We surveyed published `female song' papers within the last 20 years, recording counts of author gender and authorship position (first, middle, last). We compared these data to a control group of `birdsong' papers that were matched by journal and publication date. We found strong associations between research topic and author gender. First authors of female birdsong papers are significantly more likely to be women: women now make up 68\% of first authors on female birdsong papers whereas women are only 44\% of the first authors on general birdsong papers. Our case study suggests that women are making a greater contribution to the emerging field of female birdsong. This discrepancy demonstrates the importance of diversity in addressing previously understudied areas of science. Increasing diversity in science can lead to new approaches for studying behaviour, ecology and conservation.},

  abstract = {Many animal species communicate with their mates through acoustic signals, but this communication seems to become a struggle in urbanized areas because of increasing anthropogenic noise levels. Several bird species have been reported to increase song frequency by which they reduce the masking impact of spectrally overlapping noise. However, it remains unclear whether such behavioral flexibility provides a sufficient solution to noisy urban conditions or whether there are hidden costs. Species may rely on low frequencies to attract and impress females, and the use of high frequencies may, therefore, come at the cost of reduced attractiveness. We studied the potential tradeoff between signal strength and signal detection in a successful urban bird species, the great tit (Parus major). We show that the use of low-frequency songs by males is related to female fertility as well as sexual fidelity. We experimentally show that urban noise conditions impair male-female communication and that signal efficiency depends on song frequency in the presence of noise. Our data reveal a response advantage for high-frequency songs during sexual signaling in noisy conditions, whereas low-frequency songs are likely to be preferred. These data are critical for our understanding of the impact of anthropogenic noise on wild-ranging birds, because they provide evidence for low-frequency songs being linked to reproductive success and to be affected by noise-dependent signal efficiency.},

However, many animals have various signal strategies to cope with noise, although it is unclear whether they rely on direct auditory feedback from their own perception of noise or signal-to-noise level or on indirect social feedback from receivers. 2. We studied the role of social feedback on male great tit (Parus major) song adjustment by exclusively exposing females to artificial traffic noise inside their nest box. 3. We found a delay in female response latencies to male song in the noisy condition compared to the control condition on the first day of noise exposure. Males from the noise treatment group, not directly exposed to noise themselves, sang closer to the nest box within 3 days after the start of exposure. 4. The male's closer proximity to the nest box most likely led to the observed higher song amplitudes at the noisy nest boxes compared to quiet control nest boxes, and explains why the inside signal-to-noise ratios were restored to equal levels between treatment and control nest boxes after several days of exposure. 5. The initial difference between treatment groups in female response latencies at the start of exposure also disappeared accordingly. 6. Our results strongly suggest an active role for female birds in steering male song behaviour under noisy conditions. Males did not receive direct exposure during intra-pair communication, but adjusted their behaviour in the predicted direction. These data are important to understand the mechanisms related to communication in noise and reveal the critical role of ecology in shaping animal interactions. \textcopyright{} 2012 British Ecological Society.},

Although the brain areas indispensable for speech and song learning are known, the neural circuits important for enhanced or reduced vocal performance remain unclear. By combining in vivo structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging with song analyses in juvenile male zebra finches during song learning and beyond, we reveal that song imitation accuracy correlates with the structural architecture of four distinct brain areas, none of which pertain to the song control system. Furthermore, the structural properties of a secondary auditory area in the left hemisphere, are capable to predict future song copying accuracy, already at the earliest stages of learning, before initiating vocal practicing. These findings appoint novel brain regions important for song learning outcome and inform that ultimate performance in part depends on factors experienced before vocal practicing.}

  abstract = {Ever since Alfred R. Wallace suggested brightly coloured, toxic insects warn predators about their unprofitability, evolutionary biologists have searched for an explanation of how these aposematic prey evolve and are maintained in natural populations. Understanding how predators learn about this widespread prey defence is fundamental to addressing the problem, yet individuals differ in their foraging decisions and the predominant application of associative learning theory largely ignores predators' foraging context. Here we revisit the suggestion made 15 years ago that signal detection theory provides a useful framework to model predator learning by emphasizing the integration of prior information into predation decisions. Using multiple experiments where we modified the availability of social information using video playback, we show that personal information (sampling aposematic prey) improves how predators (great tits, \emph{Parus major}) discriminate between novel aposematic and cryptic prey. However, this relationship was not linear and beyond a certain point personal encounters with aposematic prey were no longer informative for prey discrimination. Social information about prey unpalatability reduced attacks on aposematic prey across learning trials, but it did not influence the relationship between personal sampling and discrimination. Our results suggest therefore that acquiring social information does not influence the value of personal information, but more experiments are needed to manipulate pay-offs and disentangle whether information sources affect response thresholds or change discrimination.}

Even in the same species, local populations often have somewhat different songs (i.e. dialects). Birds might discriminate nonlocal dialects from local dialects due to the differences in acoustic characteristics between them. Discrimination of nonlocal dialects from individuals' own dialects has the potential to promote reproductive isolation. Individuals in populations with sympatric related species that sing similar songs might discriminate not only heterospecific songs but also the nonlocal dialects of conspecifics. In populations without sympatric related species, individuals may not need to distinguish local conspecific songs from similar types of songs and may not discriminate nonlocal dialects from their own dialect. I investigated this hypothesis using Japanese tits, Parus minor, and varied tits, Poecile varius, in the Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan. I performed playback experiments to simulate territorial intrusions by forming pairs of two populations: one lived with, and the other without, the related tit species. The results from two and three paired populations of Japanese and varied tits, respectively, showed that males living with other sympatric species responded strongly to their own dialects but weakly to foreign dialects of conspecifics. Additionally, males living without a related species did not respond differently to the dialects. This asymmetric response pattern indicates that sympatric related species have important effects on response to conspecific song dialects, which may have implications for gene flow and reproductive isolation among populations with differing dialects.},

We documented the normative beliefs and cooperative dispositions of 759 individuals spanning nine clans nested within four pastoral ethnic groups of Kenya\textemdash the Turkana, Samburu, Rendille and Borana. We find that cooperation between groups is predicted by how culturally similar they are, suggesting that norms of cooperation in these societies have evolved under the influence of group-level selection on cultural variation. Such selection acting over human evolutionary history may explain why we cooperate readily with unrelated and unfamiliar individuals, and why humans' unprecedented cooperative flexibility is nevertheless culturally parochial.}

  abstract = {The phenotype of 48, XXYY syndrome (referred to as XXYY) is associated with characteristic but variable developmental, cognitive, behavioral and physical abnormalities. To discern the neuroanatomical phenotype of the syndrome, we conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses on MRI brain scans from 25 males with XXYY and 92 age and SES matched typically developing XY males. Quantitatively, males in the XXYY group had smaller gray and white matter volumes of the frontal and temporal lobes. Conversely, both gray and white matter volumes of the parietal lobe as well as lateral ventricular volume were larger in the XXYY group. Qualitatively, males in the XXYY group had a higher incidence of colpocephaly (84\% vs. 34\%, p {$\leq$} 0.001), white matter lesions (25\% vs. 5\%, p = 0.007), and thin posterior body of the corpus callosum (28\% vs. 3\%, p = 0.001). The specificity of these findings may shed light on the role of the X and Y chromosomes in typical and atypical brain development and help provide direction for future studies of brain-behavior relationships in males with XXYY syndrome.},

Here, using MEG we directly investigated how these visual signals interact with rhythmic brain activity in participants listening to and seeing the speaker. First, we investigated coherence between oscillatory brain activity and speaker's lip movements and demonstrated significant entrainment in visual cortex. We then used partial coherence to remove contributions of the coherent auditory speech signal from the lip-brain coherence. Comparing this synchronization between different attention conditions revealed that attending visual speech enhances the coherence between activity in visual cortex and the speaker's lips. Further, we identified a significant partial coherence between left motor cortex and lip movements and this partial coherence directly predicted comprehension accuracy. Our results emphasize the importance of visually entrained and attention-modulated rhythmic brain activity for the enhancement of audiovisual speech processing.},

Equally well known is the tendency for an orientation bias in scene content with the predominant bias in content at the horizontal and vertical orientations. This has led to the suggestion of a relationship in which the mechanisms of the human visual system are optimized for processing such regularities. Here we review current literature concerning the measurement of these regularities (via Fourier analysis) of natural scenes in the context of other work that has psychophysically assessed the extent to which visual perception exploits such regularities of spatial content. In addition, 2 psychophysical experiments are presented that extend this literature and argue for the importance of these regularities in perceiving orientation in real-world visual stimuli.},

  abstract = {To date global research on depression has used assessment tools based on research and clinical experience drawn from Western populations (i.e., in North American, European and Australian). There may be features of depression in non-Western populations which are not captured in current diagnostic criteria or measurement tools, as well as criteria for depression that are not relevant in other regions. We investigated this possibility through a systematic review of qualitative studies of depression worldwide. Nine online databases were searched for records that used qualitative methods to study depression. Initial searches were conducted between August 2012 and December 2012; an updated search was repeated in June of 2015 to include relevant literature published between December 30, 2012 and May 30, 2015. No date limits were set for inclusion of articles. A total of 16,130 records were identified and 138 met full inclusion criteria. Included studies were published between 1976 and 2015. These 138 studies represented data on 170 different study populations (some reported on multiple samples) and 77 different nationalities/ethnicities. Variation in results by geographical region, gender, and study context were examined to determine the consistency of descriptions across populations. Fisher's exact tests were used to compare frequencies of features across region, gender and context. Seven of the 15 features with the highest relative frequency form part of the DSM-5 diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, many of the other features with relatively high frequencies across the studies are associated features in the DSM, but are not prioritized as diagnostic criteria and therefore not included in standard instruments. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria of problems with concentration and psychomotor agitation or slowing were infrequently mentioned. This research suggests that the DSM model and standard instruments currently based on the DSM may not adequately reflect the experience of depression at the worldwide or regional levels.},

  abstract = {Overdispersion is a common feature of models of biological data, but researchers often fail to model the excess variation driving the overdispersion, resulting in biased parameter estimates and standard errors. Quantifying and modeling overdispersion when it is present is therefore critical for robust biological inference. One means to account for overdispersion is to add an observation-level random effect (OLRE) to a model, where each data point receives a unique level of a random effect that can absorb the extra-parametric variation in the data. Although some studies have investigated the utility of OLRE to model overdispersion in Poisson count data, studies doing so for Binomial proportion data are scarce. Here I use a simulation approach to investigate the ability of both OLRE models and Beta-Binomial models to recover unbiased parameter estimates in mixed effects models of Binomial data under various degrees of overdispersion. In addition, as ecologists often fit random intercept terms to models when the random effect sample size is low ({$<$}5 levels), I investigate the performance of both model types under a range of random effect sample sizes when overdispersion is present. Simulation results revealed that the efficacy of OLRE depends on the process that generated the overdispersion; OLRE failed to cope with overdispersion generated from a Beta-Binomial mixture model, leading to biased slope and intercept estimates, but performed well for overdispersion generated by adding random noise to the linear predictor. Comparison of parameter estimates from an OLRE model with those from its corresponding Beta-Binomial model readily identified when OLRE were performing poorly due to disagreement between effect sizes, and this strategy should be employed whenever OLRE are used for Binomial data to assess their reliability. Beta-Binomial models performed well across all contexts, but showed a tendency to underestimate effect sizes when modelling non-Beta-Binomial data. Finally, both OLRE and Beta-Binomial models performed poorly when models contained {$<$}5 levels of the random intercept term, especially for estimating variance components, and this effect appeared independent of total sample size. These results suggest that OLRE are a useful tool for modelling overdispersion in Binomial data, but that they do not perform well in all circumstances and researchers should take care to verify the robustness of parameter estimates of OLRE models.},

  abstract = {The oscine passerines, an avian suborder that comprises almost half of all bird species worldwide, learn their song primarily through cultural transmission. As the world's forests become increasingly fragmented and the population sizes of many forest-dwelling species decline, there may be increasingly restricted opportunities for the transmission of cultural information. However, the effects of forest fragmentation on birdsong have not been well documented. In this paper, we examine the relationship between forest fragment size and song characteristics for two forest bird species, an oscine passerine (orange-billed sparrow, Arremon aurantiirostris) that learns its song culturally, and a suboscine passerine (scale-crested pygmy tyrant, Lophotriccus pileatus) that does not. Recordings were taken from individuals in 12 premontane wet forest fragments ranging in size from approximately 1.4 ha\textendash 360 ha in southern Costa Rica. As predicted under the `cultural erosion' hypothesis, we found that acoustic characteristics associated with song complexity such as the number of syllables per song and song duration decreased with decreasing fragment size for the oscine but not for the suboscine species. This study supports the idea that learned cultural elements are sensitive to fragment size and that cultural diversity should be considered along with other forms of biodiversity in the conservation of social learning species.},

  abstract = {Cranial morphology is widely used to reconstruct evolutionary relationships, but its reliability in reflecting phylogeny and population history has been questioned. Some cranial regions, particularly the face and neurocranium, are believed to be influenced by the environment and prone to convergence. Others, such as the temporal bone, are thought to reflect more accurately phylogenetic relationships. Direct testing of these hypotheses was not possible until the advent of large genetic data sets. The few relevant studies in human populations have had intriguing but possibly conflicting results, probably partly due to methodological differences and to the small numbers of populations used. Here we use three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics methods to test explicitly the ability of cranial shape, size, and relative position/orientation of cranial regions to track population history and climate. Morphological distances among 13 recent human populations were calculated from four 3D landmark data sets, respectively reflecting facial, neurocranial, and temporal bone shape; shape and relative position; overall cranial shape; and centroid sizes. These distances were compared to neutral genetic and climatic distances among the same, or closely matched, populations. Results indicate that neurocranial and temporal bone shape track neutral genetic distances, while facial shape reflects climate; centroid size shows a weak association with climatic variables; and relative position/orientation of cranial regions does not appear correlated with any of these factors. Because different cranial regions preserve population history and climate signatures differentially, caution is suggested when using cranial anatomy for phylogenetic reconstruction.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Music and dance are universal across human culture and have an ancient history. One characteristic of music is its strong influence on movement. For example, an auditory beat induces rhythmic movement with positive emotions in humans from early developmental stages. In this study, we investigated if sound induced spontaneous rhythmic movement in chimpanzees. Three experiments showed that: 1) an auditory beat induced rhythmic swaying and other rhythmic movements, with larger responses from male chimpanzees than female chimpanzees; 2) random beat as well as regular beat induced rhythmic swaying and beat tempo affected movement periodicity in a chimpanzee in a bipedal posture; and 3) a chimpanzee showed close proximity to the sound source while hearing auditory stimuli. The finding that male chimpanzees showed a larger response to sound than female chimpanzees was consistent with previous literature about "rain dances" in the wild, where male chimpanzees engage in rhythmic displays when hearing the sound of rain starting. The fact that rhythmic swaying was induced regardless of beat regularity may be a critical difference from humans, and a further study should reveal the physiological properties of sound that induce rhythmic movements in chimpanzees. These results suggest some biological foundation for dancing existed in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees {$\sim$}6 million years ago. As such, this study supports the evolutionary origins of musicality.}

FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).},

  abstract = {Extremely high variability in genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in vertebrates is assumed to be a consequence of frequency-dependent parasite-driven selection and mate preferences based on promotion of offspring heterozygosity at MHC, or potentially, genome-wide inbreeding avoidance. Where effects have been found, mate choice studies on rodents and other species usually find preference for MHC-dissimilarity in potential partners. Here we critically review studies on MHC-associated mate choice in humans. These are based on three broadly different aspects: (1) odor preferences, (2) facial preferences and (3) actual mate choice surveys. As in animal studies, most odor-based studies demonstrate disassortative preferences, although there is variation in the strength and nature of the effects. In contrast, facial attractiveness research indicates a preference for MHC-similar individuals. Results concerning MHC in actual couples show a bias towards similarity in one study, dissimilarity in two studies and random distribution in several other studies. These vary greatly in sample size and heterogeneity of the sample population, both of which may significantly bias the results. This pattern of mixed results across studies may reflect context-dependent and/or life history sensitive preference expression, in addition to higher level effects arising out of population differences in genetic heterogeneity or cultural and ethnic restrictions on random mating patterns. Factors of special relevance in terms of individual preferences are reproductive status and long- vs. short-term mating context. We discuss the idea that olfactory and visual channels may work in a complementary way (i.e. odor preference for MHC-dissimilarity and visual preference for MHC-similarity) to achieve an optimal level of genetic variability, methodological issues and interesting avenues for further research. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Animal societies are shaped both by social processes and by the physical environment in which social interactions take place. While many studies take the observed patterns of inter-individual interactions as products and proxies of pure social processes, or as links between resource availability and social structure, the role of the physical configuration of habitat features in shaping the social system of group-living animals remains largely overlooked. We hypothesise that by shaping the decisions about when and where to move, physical features of the environment will impact which individuals more frequently encounter one another and in doing so the overall social structure and social organization of populations. We first discuss how the spatial arrangement of habitat components (i.e. habitat configuration) can shape animal movements using empirical cases in the literature. Then, we draw from the empirical literature to discuss how movement patterns of individuals mediate the patterns of social interactions and social organization and highlight the role of network-based approaches in identifying, evaluating and partitioning the effects of habitat configuration on animal social structure or organization. We illustrate the combination of these mechanisms using a simple simulation. Finally, we discuss the implications of habitat configuration in shaping the ecology and evolution of animal societies and offer a framework for future studies. We highlight future directions for studies in animal societies that are increasingly important in widely human-modified landscapes, in particular the implications of habitat-driven social structure in evolution. Significance statement: There is now clear evidence that simple processes can generate apparent complex patterns of social structure. However, while studies such as those on collective behaviour and social networks have been focused on processes involving individual decision-making, broader patterns of social structure and social organization can also be shaped by factors that have more fundamental impacts on the movements of animals. One set of those factors is related to the amount and spatial arrangement of both biotic and abiotic components of the habitat in which animals live. Examples include the configuration formed by habitat patches connected through corridors, by the presence of hard boundaries between habitat types or by the uneven distribution of resources, mates and competitors across space. In this contribution, we highlight the potential effects of these, which are becoming increasingly important as studies start being able to track populations spanning larger landscapes.},

These realized combinations of survival, development and reproduction are predicted to be constrained by physiological limitations and by trade-offs in resource allocation. However, our understanding of these patterns is restricted to a few taxonomic groups. Using demographic data from 121 species, ranging from humans to sponges, we test whether such trade-offs universally shape animal life history strategies. We show that, after accounting for body mass and phylogenetic relatedness, 71\% of the variation in animal life history strategies can be explained by life history traits associated with the fast\textendash slow continuum (pace of life) and with a second axis defined by the distribution of age-specific mortality hazards and the spread of reproduction. While we found that life history strategies are associated with metabolic rate and ecological modes of life, surprisingly similar life history strategies can be found across the phylogenetic and physiological diversity of animals.}

  abstract = {Body size and metabolic rate both fundamentally constrain how species interact with their environment, and hence ultimately affect their niche. While many mechanisms leading to these constraints have been explored, their effects on the resolution at which temporal information is perceived have been largely overlooked. The visual system acts as a gateway to the dynamic environment and the relative resolution at which organisms are able to acquire and process visual information is likely to restrict their ability to interact with events around them. As both smaller size and higher metabolic rates should facilitate rapid behavioural responses, we hypothesized that these traits would favour perception of temporal change over finer timescales. Using critical flicker fusion frequency, the lowest frequency of flashing at which a flickering light source is perceived as constant, as a measure of the maximum rate of temporal information processing in the visual system, we carried out a phylogenetic comparative analysis of a wide range of vertebrates that supported this hypothesis. Our results have implications for the evolution of signalling systems and predator\textendash prey interactions, and, combined with the strong influence that both body mass and metabolism have on a species' ecological niche, suggest that time perception may constitute an important and overlooked dimension of niche differentiation.},

  abstract = {In many species of songbird, individuals sing multiple song types, some of which are shared with their neighbours. Individuals may also share syntactical rules that govern the transitions between different song types, but few studies have attempted to study this kind of sharing. Progress has been inhibited by a lack of statistical tools to compare song-type transitions among individuals. We present a straightforward method for comparing song transitions based on Markov transition matrices. The method calculates the number of mutually preferred song-type-to-different-song-type transitions found in the song sequences of two birds, then assesses whether that number is significantly greater than would be expected if the two birds ordered their songs independently of one another. We applied this method to song sequences from five songbird species. All pairwise comparisons among male Cassin's vireos, Vireo cassinii, showed significant similarity in song transitions, as did a minority of comparisons among Adelaide's warblers, Setophaga adelaidae, and one pair of marsh wrens, Cistothorus palustris. In contrast, dyads of rock wrens, Salpinctes obsoletus, and rufous-and-white wrens, Thryophilus rufalbus, did not share song-type transitions at levels exceeding chance. Interterritory distance was not significantly related to our measure of song transition similarity in any of our study species. These results provide evidence that interindividual similarity in song-type transitions is a trait that varies considerably among species. We discuss the potential drivers of similarity in song transitions, but note that assessing its evolutionary breadth will require a larger sample of species. The application of our method to additional species will provide a more comprehensive understanding of signal use and vocal interaction in songbirds.},

We found that most V2 cells responded well to at least some of the complex stimuli, and in many V2 cells the most effective complex stimulus elicited a significantly larger response than the most effective bar or sinusoid. Approximately one-third of the V2 cells showed significant differential responsiveness to various complex shape characteristics, and many were also selective for the orientation, size, and/or spatial frequency of the preferred shape.

In addition to genetic inheritance, parent\textendash offspring similarity is affected by epigenetic, behavioural and cultural mechanisms that collectively can be referred to as non-genetic inheritance. Given the generality of the Price equation as a description of evolutionary change, is it not surprising that the Price equation has been adopted to model the evolutionary implications of non-genetic inheritance. In this paper, we briefly introduce the heredity perspectives on which those models rely, discuss the extent to which these perspectives make different assumptions and place different emphases on the roles of heredity and development in evolution, and the types of empirical research programmes they motivate. The existence of multiple perspectives and explanatory aims highlight, on the one hand, the versatility of the Price equation and, on the other hand, the importance of understanding how heredity and development can be conceptualized in evolutionary studies.}

Extending work by Huttenlocher et~al.

The combination of prior knowledge and noisy memory representations is dependent on familiarity. We present empirical evidence of the influences of prior knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction, showing that the reconstruction of familiar objects is influenced toward the specific prior for that object, while unfamiliar objects are influenced toward the overall category.},

  abstract = {Unlike other animal species, much of the variation among human groups is cultural: genetically similar people living in similar environments exhibit strikingly different patterns of behavior because they have different, culturally acquired beliefs and values. Such cultural transmission is based on complex, derived psychological mechanisms that are likely to have been shaped by natural selection. It is important to understand the nature of these evolved psychological mechanisms because they determine which beliefs and values spread and persist in human groups. Boyd and Richerson showed that a tendency to acquire the most common behavior exhibited in a society was adaptive in a simple model of evolution in a spatially varying environment, because such a tendency increases the probability of acquiring adaptive beliefs and values. Here, we study the evolution of such "conformist transmission" in a more general model in which environments vary in both time and space. The analysis of this model indicates that conformist transmission is favored under a very broad range of conditions, broader in fact than the range of conditions that favor a substantial reliance on social learning. The analysis also suggests that there is a synergistic relationship between the evolution of imitation and the evolution of conformism. We conclude by examining the role of conformism in explaining the maintenance of cultural differences among groups. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.},

  abstract = {Social communication often involves vocal learning, whereby young animals learn their vocalizations early in life by imitating the sounds of adults. In animals that learn their vocalizations, it is common to find patterns of geographical variation known as `vocal dialects', acoustic features shared within a cluster of animals that differ from the vocalizations of animals in nearby clusters. Dialects may form when animals learn their vocalizations early in life and then disperse short distances, or when they modify their vocalizations to match local vocal patterns after dispersal. Dialects are typically studied at a regional or continental scale, but they may also persist at smaller scales in so-called `microgeographical song dialects' or `microdialects'. Microdialects have received little research attention. In this study, we investigate microdialects and dispersal distance in song-learning Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, through a 4-year study of birds living on three islands in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Our analyses yield evidence of microgeographical variation: birds showed higher acoustic similarity to their neighbours than to faraway individuals in the same population. When we classified songs on the basis of their highly variable middle sections, we found that particular song types formed spatial clusters of similar-sounding individuals. Therefore, acoustic variation in Savannah sparrow song appears to show dialects across small geographical distances. In an analysis of dispersal from natal sites to breeding sites, we found a median distance of 189 m, consistent with previous findings. Our results suggest that limited dispersal distances, combined with the social processes of vocal learning (overproduction and selective attrition), likely contribute to the presence of microdialects.},

  abstract = {Rhythmicity in the millisecond to second range is a fundamental building block of communication and coordinated movement. But how widespread are rhythmic capacities across species, and how did they evolve under different environmental pressures? Comparative research is necessary to answer these questions but has been hindered by limited crosstalk and comparability among results from different study species. Most acoustics studies do not explicitly focus on characterising or quantifying rhythm, but many are just a few scrapes away from contributing to and advancing the field of comparative rhythm research. Here, we present an eight-level rhythm reporting framework which details actionable steps researchers can take to report rhythm-relevant metrics. Levels fall into two categories: metric reporting and data sharing. Metric reporting levels include defining rhythm-relevant metrics, providing point estimates of temporal interval variability, reporting interval distributions, and conducting rhythm analyses. Data sharing levels are: sharing audio recordings, sharing interval durations, sharing sound element start and end times, and sharing audio recordings with sound element start/end times. Using sounds recorded from a sperm whale as a case study, we demonstrate how each reporting framework level can be implemented on real data. We also highlight existing best practice examples from recent research spanning multiple species. We clearly detail how engagement with our framework can be tailored case-by-case based on how much time and effort researchers are willing to contribute. Finally, we illustrate how reporting at any of the suggested levels will help advance comparative rhythm research. This framework will actively facilitate a comparative approach to acoustic rhythms while also promoting cooperation and data sustainability. By quantifying and reporting rhythm metrics more consistently and broadly, new avenues of inquiry and several long-standing, big picture research questions become more tractable. These lines of research can inform not only about the behavioural ecology of animals but also about the evolution of rhythm-relevant phenomena and the behavioural neuroscience of rhythm production and perception. Rhythm is clearly an emergent feature of life; adopting our framework, researchers from different fields and with different study species can help understand why.},

FoxP2 is enriched in corticostriatal circuits of both human and songbird brains. Experimental knockdown of this enrichment in song control neurons of the zebra finch basal ganglia impairs tutor song imitation, indicating that adequate FoxP2 levels are necessary for normal vocal learning. In unmanipulated birds, vocal practice acutely downregu- lates FoxP2, leading to increased vocal variability and dynamic regulation of FoxP2 target genes. To determine whether this behavioral regulation is important for song learning, here, we used viral-driven overexpression of FoxP2 to counteract its downregulation. This manipulation disrupted the acute effects of song practice on vocal variability and caused inaccurate song imitation. Together, these findings indicate that dynamic behavior-linked regulation of FoxP2, rather than absolute levels, is critical for vocal learning.},

What accounts for our capacity to understand the way the physical world works, to think ourselves into the minds of others, to gossip, read, tell stories about the past, and imagine the future? These questions are not new: they have been debated by philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists, evolutionists, and neurobiologists over the course of centuries. One explanation widely accepted today is that humans have special cognitive instincts. Unlike other living animal species, we are born with complicated mechanisms for reasoning about causation, reading the minds of others, copying behaviors, and using language. Cecilia Heyes agrees that adult humans have impressive pieces of cognitive equipment. In her framing, however, these cognitive gadgets are not instincts programmed in the genes but are constructed in the course of childhood through social interaction. Cognitive gadgets are products of cultural evolution, rather than genetic evolution. At birth, the minds of human babies are only subtly different from the minds of newborn chimpanzees. We are friendlier, our attention is drawn to different things, and we have a capacity to learn and remember that outstrips the abilities of newborn chimpanzees. Yet when these subtle differences are exposed to culture-soaked human environments, they have enormous effects. They enable us to upload distinctively human ways of thinking from the social world around us. As Cognitive Gadgets makes clear, from birth our malleable human minds can learn through culture not only what to think but how to think it.-- A question and many answers -- Nature, nurture, culture -- Starter kit -- Cultural learning -- Selective social learning -- Imitation -- Mindreading -- Language -- Cultural evolutionary psychology.},

  abstract = {The Baldwin effect is a hypothetical process in which a learned response to environmental change evolves a genetic basis. Modelling has shown that the Baldwin effect offers a plausible and elegant explanation for the emergence of complex behavioural traits, but there is little direct empirical evidence for its occurrence. We highlight experimental evidence of the Baldwin effect and argue that it acts preferentially on peripheral rather than on central cognitive processes. Careful scrutiny of research on taste-aversion and fear learning, language, and imitation indicates that their efficiency depends on adaptively specialised input and output processes: analogues of scanner and printer interfaces that feed information to core inference processes and structure their behavioural expression. Sinking In Which features of the human mind, now genetically inherited, were once the products of learning? This question relates to the Baldwin effect (see Glossary)-a process in which an initially learned response to environmental change acquires a genetic basis [1-4]. This process is also known, sometimes in a misleading way [5], as organic selection [1], genetic assimilation [6], and expe-riential canalization [7]. Whatever it is called, Baldwin's hypothesis postulates that, at the population level, learned characteristics can 'sink in'; they can become part of what offspring inherit organically from their parents. In the following we bring empirical research from cognitive science to bear on the hypothesis that some aspects of human cognition have sunk in-that they were initially learned and are now genetically inherited. We argue that there is good empirical evidence for this hypothesis regarding peripheral cognitive mechanisms (i.e., input or perceptual systems, and output or action systems, both modulated by attention and motivation), but not for the complex and interlocking central processes , involving inference and memory, that have durable effects on the relationships between perception and action [8] (Figure 1, Key Figure). After introducing the Baldwin effect, we next focus on preparedness [9,10]. For 50 years, experimental psychologists have investigated the preparedness of mechanisms involved in learning taste aversions and fears, and how these mechanisms have been specialised by evolution to do their jobs well. We argue that this research not only provides much-needed empirical evidence of Baldwinisation but also illuminates the targets of selection. Specifically, research on preparedness suggests that, across species, Baldwinisation has had a much greater impact on peripheral than on central cognitive mechanisms [11]. There has been genetic assimilation of learning-induced changes in perception, attention, motivation, and motor control-processes that modulate inputs to, and outputs from, the core inference processes of the brain-but little if any change to the structure of central processors themselves. We then extend the analysis to language and imitation, human faculties that are widely thought to have been genetically assimilated. The evidence here Highlights Evolution targets peripheral, not central, aspects of cognition. Many peripheral mechanisms have evolved via the Baldwin effect. 'Garcia effects' on taste-aversion learning have not withstood the test of time. Fear learning is 'prepared' by attentional rather than by learning mechanisms. Specialization for language processing has focussed on perceptuomotor aspects of speech rather than on innate principles of universal grammar. There is no innate module for imitation but enhanced social motivation consequently leads to greater attention to the behaviour of other agents.},

  abstract = {There has been much speculation about modern environments causing an epidemic of depression. This review aims to (1) determine whether depression rates have increased and (2) review evidence for possible explanations. While available data indicate rising prevalence and an increased lifetime risk for younger cohorts, strong conclusions cannot be drawn due to conflicting results and methodological flaws. There are numerous potential explanations for changing rates of depression. Cross-cultural studies can be useful for identifying likely culprits. General and specific characteristics of modernization correlate with higher risk. A positive correlation between a country's GDP per capita, as a quantitative measure of modernization, and lifetime risk of a mood disorder trended toward significance (p = 0.06). Mental and physical well-being are intimately related. The growing burden of chronic diseases, which arise from an evolutionary mismatch between past human environments and modern-day living, may be central to rising rates of depression. Declining social capital and greater inequality and loneliness are candidate mediators of a depressiogenic social milieu. Modern populations are increasingly overfed, malnourished, sedentary, sunlight-deficient, sleep-deprived, and socially-isolated. These changes in lifestyle each contribute to poor physical health and affect the incidence and treatment of depression. The review ends with a call for future research and policy interventions to address this public health crisis. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Males with large repertoires held territories longer and had greater annual and lifetime reproductive success than males with small repertoires. Half-hour repertoire size, which may represent an ecologically more relevant measure of repertoire size perceived by a transient listener, was also positively related to territory tenure and annual reproductive success.

Elucidation of intraspecific variation in song complexity can provide insights into its evolution.

At two separate nature reserves, we recorded male songs in two habitat types: forest remnants with high habitat complexity, and open habitats with lower habitat complexity. Analyses indicated strong evidence that song complexity was higher in forest habitats. Possible explanations for this divergence include: (i) competition between individuals results in higher quality, dominant males with more complex songs occupying forest habitats, and less competitive males occupying open habitat zones; (ii) forest habitats provide more abundant resources therefore higher t\=u\=i density, resulting in more complex songs; and (iii) a higher abundance of food in dense forest habitats may reduce nutritional stress during development resulting in full development of song nuclei. However, these hypotheses on the drivers of habitat effects on t\=u\=i song complexity remain to be tested.},

  abstract = {Wintering songbirds have been widely shown to make economic foraging decisions to manage the changing balance of risks from predation and starvation over the course of the day. In this study, we ask whether the com- munication and use of information about food availability differ throughout the day. First, we assessed temporal variation in food-related vocal infor- mation produced in foraging flocks of tits (Paridae) using audio recordings at radio-frequency identification-equipped feeding stations. Vocal activity was highest in the morning and decreased into the afternoon. This pattern was not explained by there being fewer birds present, as we found that group sizes increased over the course of the day. Next, we experimentally tested the underlying causes for this diurnal calling pattern.We set up bird fee- ders with or without playback of calls from tits, either in the morning or in the afternoon, and compared latency to feeder discovery, accumulation of flock members, and total number of birds visiting the feeder. Irrespective of time of day, playbacks had a strong effect on all three responsemeasures whencom- pared to silent control trials, demonstrating that tits will readily use vocal information to improve food detection throughout the day. Thus, the diurnal pattern of foraging behaviour did not appear to affect use and production of food-related vocalizations. Instead, we suggest that, as the day progresses and foraging group sizes increase, the costs of producing calls at the food source (e.g. competition and attraction of predators) outweigh the benefits of recruiting group members (i.e. adding individuals to large groups only mar- ginally increases safety in numbers), causing the observed decrease in vocal activity into the afternoon. Our findings imply that individuals make econ- omic social adjustments based on conditions of their social environment when deciding to vocally recruit group members.},

  doi = {10.1098/rspb.2019.0510},
  abstract = {Free will is an apparent paradox because it requires a historical identity to escape its history in a self-guided fashion. Philosophers have itemized design features necessary for this escape, scaling from action to agency and vice versa. These can be organized into a coherent framework that neurocognitive capacities provide and that form a basis for neurocognitive free will. These capacities include (1) adaptive access to unpredictability, (2) tuning of this unpredictability in the service of hierarchical goal structures, (3) goal-directed deliberation via search over internal cognitive representations, and (4) a role for conscious construction of the self in the generation and choice of alternatives. This frames free will as a process of generative self-construction, by which an iterative search process samples from experience in an adaptively exploratory fashion, allowing the agent to explore itself in the construction of alternative futures. This provides an explanation of how effortful conscious control modulates adaptive access to unpredictability and resolves one of free will's key conceptual problems: how randomness is used in the service of the will. The implications provide a contemporary neurocognitive grounding to compatibilist and libertarian positions on free will, and demonstrate how neurocognitive understanding can contribute to this debate by presenting free will as an interaction between our freedom and our will.}

Using sentiment analysis on the basis of psychological valence norms, we compute a national valence index for the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and Italy, indicating relative happiness in response to national and international wars and in comparison to historical trends in longevity and gross domestic product. We validate our method using Eurobarometer survey data from the 1970s and demonstrate robustness using words with stable historical meanings, diverse corpora (newspapers, magazines and books) and additional word norms.

  abstract = {Examining the factors that influence contemporary genetic patterns is important given the alarming rate at which natural environments are changing. In particular habitat fragmentation and climate change are expected to influence the distribution and diversity of natural populations. In this study we used both mitochondrial control region (mtDNA) and microsatellite data to answer the following questions about genetic diversity and divergence in mountain chickadees (Poecile gambeli) a resident bird species in western North America: (1) Do populations exhibit similar levels of genetic diversity across the range? (2) What is the genetic affinity of western populations in Oregon and Washington? (3) Do genetic patterns exhibit isolation by distance, or are genetic patterns more heavily influenced by habitat discontinuity? We tested the effects of isolation by distance and habitat distribution on genetic structure by analyzing 266 samples from 17 sites across western Canada and the United States. We found a near significant relationship between genetic diversity and latitude, however, our results indicate that overall, latitude is not a strong predictor of genetic diversity. Our analyses of populations in Oregon and Washington revealed a mismatch between patterns detected with mtDNA and microsatellite data. In particular, Washington clustered with the Coast Range/Cascades/Rocky Mountain mtDNA group, but with populations in southern Oregon/California based on microsatellite data. These results suggest the presence of a contact zone in Washington between the two mtDNA clades Coast Range/Cascades/Rocky Mountain and southern Oregon/California clades. Finally, our study revealed a greater effect of isolation by distance than isolation by habitat for both mtDNA and microsatellite data. Overall the isolation by distance signal was greater for mtDNA than microsatellite patterns. The greater signal of isolation by distance on mtDNA patterns likely reflects the strong effects of Pleistocene glaciations in shaping genetic patterns in western North America. Although life history and historical processes are the primary factors shaping an organism's evolutionary history , one must consider the role of contemporary processes on genetic variation 1-3. Contemporary processes are especially important given the alarming rate that environments are changing and the effects of these changes on populations 4-6. One only has to look at the Pleistocene glaciations to see the historical impact of climate change on population genetic structure. The fragmentation of populations due to repeated habitat contractions and expansions led to many recent speciation events 7 and fragmented habitat including the separation of coniferous forests in western North America 8. In the Pacific Northwest, the legacy of the last glacial maximum (LGM) combined with contemporary landscape features on population genetic structure is especially evident. Within this region, many subalpine species exhibit concordant genetic breaks associated with habitat fragmentation and isolation across arid, low elevation barriers, emphasizing the role of habitat discontinuity on genetic diversity and population differentiation 9-14. Environmental change (i.e. habitat fragmentation) impacts not only the landscape, but also behaviour and demographic factors.

We investigated how climate affected habitat quality using great tits (Parus major) breeding in woodland in eastern England. Mean chick body mass was used as a measure of habitat quality. Mean canopy height, calculated from a lidar digital canopy height model, was used as a measure of habitat structure. The influence of canopy height on body mass was examined for seven years during which weather conditions varied. The slopes and correlation coefficients of the mass/height relationships were related linearly to the warmth sum, an index of spring warmth, such that chick mass declined with canopy height in cold, late springs, but increased with height in warm, early springs. The parameters of the mass/height relationships, and the warmth sum, were also related linearly to the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index, but with a time lag of one year. Within the same wood, the structure conferring ``best'' habitat quality differed between years depending on weather conditions.}

Here, we examine distributions of mutational effects for gene expression in the budding yeast {$<$}em{$>$}Saccharomyces cerevisiae{$<$}/em{$>$} by measuring the effects of thousands of point mutations introduced randomly throughout the genome. We find that the distributions of mutational effects differ for the 10 genes surveyed and are inconsistent with normality. For example, all 10 distributions of mutational effects included more mutations with large effects than expected for normally distributed phenotypes. In addition, some genes also showed asymmetries in their distribution of mutational effects, with new mutations more likely to increase than decrease the gene's expression or vice versa. Neutral models of regulatory evolution that take these empirically determined distributions into account suggest that neutral processes may explain more expression variation within natural populations than currently appreciated.}

  abstract = {Humans are unique in the animal world in the extent to which we have the potential to affect our own biological evolution through culturally mediated behavioural variation. However, there is scant clear evidence of the phenomenon. Here, I estimate genetic diversity for every county in the US by merging demographic data from the 2010 US Census with genomic reference populations and show that genetic diversity is predicted by cultural variation as reflected by the 2016 Presidential Election. Remarkably, the 2016 Election alone explains 18\% of US county-level variation in genetic diversity, with diversity decreasing as Trump support increases. When state level variation is included in the model, 71\% of variation is explained. Within states, genetic segregation increases with cultural segregation. I then tested whether the observed genetic patterns might be explained by culture acting on race and ethnicity and found that genetic diversity tends to increase with racial and ethnic diversity, and that the 2016 Election is an even better predictor of the US landscape of ethnic diversity. Finally, I measured patterns of ethnic assortative mating nationwide from the Census data, and found that ethnic assortment is primarily explained by the proportion of minorities in each county, and that the most diverse counties are the most assortative. Overall, regional variation in cultural tolerance appears to be structuring biological diversity on a massive scale. Also, assortative mating is maintaining ethnic and genetic diversity within the most diverse and tolerant areas. Culture is a primary driver of biological evolution across the US.}

Similarly, the interest in symmetry has largely been restricted to understanding tool morphology that has ignored research on how this property might be processed by the brain that could help provide new insights into cognitive evolution. The purpose of this paper is therefore to bring these diverse approaches together in an effort to assimilate the various findings so that a fuller understanding of the cognitive profile of hominins during the early to Middle Pleistocene can be achieved. ?? 2008 Acad??mie des sciences.},

Recent evidence from various concurrent sites in southern Africa, including Blombos, provide the opportunity for a more nuanced analysis of the probable level of symbolic intent and how this relates to neuro-cognitive precursors. In what follows, it will be shown that, although some of the southern African artefacts do indeed demonstrate particular kinds of 'symbolic' intent, others need to be approached with caution.

  abstract = {The role of the arts has become crucial to understanding the origins of ''modern human behavior,'' but continues to be highly controversial as it is not always clear why the arts evolved and persisted. This issue is often addressed by appealing to adaptive biological explanations. However, we will argue that the arts have evolved cultur-ally rather than biologically, exploiting biological adapta-tions rather than extending them. In order to support this line of inquiry, evidence from a number of disciplines will be presented showing how the relationship between the arts, evolution, and adaptation can be better understood by regarding cultural transmission as an important second inheritance system. This will allow an alternative proposal to be formulated as to the proper place of the arts in human evolution. However, in order for the role of the arts to be fully addressed, the relationship of culture to genes and adaptation will be explored. Based on an assessment of the cognitive, biological, and cultural aspects of the arts, and their close relationship with ritual and associated activities, we will conclude with the null hypothesis that the arts evolved as a necessary but nonfunctional concomitant of other traits that cannot currently be refuted. The arts have recently become fundamental to debates on human cognitive evolution on a number of counts, with many arguing that they set humans apart from other species and are one of the main traits that define modern humans (e.g., Henshilwood and Marean 2003). As a result, evidence of early artistic behavior has given rise to intense debate. Interestingly, various artifacts have been found that increas-ingly consign the origins of modern human behavior to a period ever closer to when Homo sapiens sapiens first appeared as an anatomically modern species (*180,000 BP). Partially in response to these recent finds, the debate as to whether the arts are biologically adaptive or are more cul-turally derived has intensified. As the arts are central to this debate, it is essential to determine their proper place in evo-lution. The aim of this article is to assess the role of the arts in relation to the trajectory of human evolution in order to avoid the confusion and pitfalls that have hindered this debate. The first part of this article will examine the relevance of aesthetics to the debate, after which we will identify the appropriate context for assessing the role of the arts and, by implication, their natural point of reference. Some recent theories that attempt to explain the arts from the perspec-tive of evolution will then be considered in light of the foregoing. By way of illustration, specific examples from the archaeological record of how the arts were utilized by ancient peoples will be presented. Having identified the practical and theoretical standpoints for assessing the role of the arts, the ramifications arising will then be explored in the second part (''Originating Mechanisms'') with a special focus on the relationship between biological adaptation, exaptation, and by-product approaches that will be assessed},

Some authorities claim the marks are in some way representational or symbolic while others are more cautious and view them as pre-symbolic in that they may derive from a proto-aesthetic bias linked to how the early visual cortex functions. Recent neuroscanning techniques have allowed these competing claims to be tested. This paper considers the implications of current neuroscanning data to understanding the derivation and import of the earliest geometric patterns. After considering the relevant neuroscientific research, it is concluded that the first nonfunctional marks may not be representational or symbolic but are closely tied to the way the early visual cortex processes visual information.},

However, these two notes are produced at a consistent relative pitch. Moreover, dominant birds more reliably produce songs with this species-typical interval, compared to subordinate birds. Therefore, we asked whether presenting the species-typical relative pitch interval would aid chickadees in solving pitch interval discriminations. We found that species-typical relative pitch intervals selectively facilitated discrimination performance using synthetic sine-wave stimuli. Using shifted fee-bee song notes from recordings of naturally produced songs, birds learned the discrimination in fewer trials overall compared to synthetic stimuli. These results may reflect greater generalization among stimuli that occur outside species-typical production parameters. In addition, although sex differences in performance are rarely observed in acoustic discriminations in chickadees, female chickadees performed more accurately compared to males. \textcopyright{} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

These combinations occurred not only between calls of similar structure and function but also between calls usually emitted in entirely different social contexts. According to the qualitative analysis, sex-specific asymmetries of the vocal behaviour were less pronounced than age-dependent characteristics. The comparison of clear call vocalizations of Macaca radiata and M. fuscata revealed significant species-specific differences on the structural and the behavioural level.

However, little is currently understood about the neurodevelopmental basis of these effects, or how genetic and epigenetic factors interact with the environment to shape the systems subserving emotionality. In this review, we discuss the use of rodent models of early life emotional experience to study these issues in the laboratory and present some of our pertinent findings. In rats, postnatal maternal separation can produce lasting increases in emotional behavior and stressor-reactivity, together with alterations in various brain neurotransmitter systems implicated in emotionality, including corticotropin-releasing factor, serotonin, norepinephrine, and glutamate. Genetic differences between inbred mouse strains have been exploited to further study how maternal behavior affects emotional development using techniques such as cross-fostering and generation of inter-strain hybrids. Together with our own recent data, the findings of these studies demonstrate the pervasive influence of maternal and social environments during sensitive developmental periods and reveal how genetic factors determine how these early life experiences can shape brain and behavior throughout life. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The process of domestication began some 250 years ago in Japan and several modifications in coloration and behavior occurred. We recently found that songs of Bengalese finches are much more complex in their temporal organizations than songs of related species such as zebra finches. We hypothesized that this complexity occurred during domestication. To explore this hypothesis, we compared syntactical and acoustical parameters of songs between the wild and domesticated strains of white-backed munia. Acoustical morphologies of the song elements were strain-specific: similarities among song elements were higher within individuals of each strain, but the degrees of morphological variations were comparable between the strains. In the time domain, white-backed munias sang a highly stereotyped song: a song element was always followed by one of certain song elements in a deterministic way. Bengalese finches, on the other hand, sang complex song with one song note followed by several possible song notes. Male songs should evolve largely under two different pressures: female preference and risk of predation. The low degree of complexity found in wild white-backed munias may be the result of compensating these two factors. In Bengalese finches, because of the domestication, predation is no longer a selection pressure. Thus, it is likely that Bengalese finch songs had undergone changes that were favored by females.}

Among the most useful tools develope d to help one understand and assess cultural proficiency is the cultural competence continuum by Terry Cross, which can be applied to institutions as well as individuals. This paradigm defines six positions along a continuum, ranging from cultural destructiveness on the negative end, to cultural incapacity, cultural blindness, cultural precompetence, cultural competence, and finally cultural proficiency on the positive end. Cultural destructiveness is represented by attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that are inherently damaging to targeted cultures and to the individuals within those cultures. Individuals in this position are typically those espousing racism, believing that a dominant race and culture is superior and seeking to suppress or eradicate other "lesser" cultures.},

However, more recent evidence suggests that sex chromosomes may also have direct upstream effects that act independently of hormones. Sex chromosome aneuploidies provide ideal models to examine this framework in humans, including Turner syndrome (TS), where females are missing one X-chromosome (45X), and Klinefelter syndrome (KS), where males have an additional X-chromosome (47XXY). As these disorders essentially represent copy number variants of the sex chromosomes, investigation of brain structure across these disorders allows us to determine whether sex chromosome gene dosage effects exist. We used voxel-based morphometry to investigate this hypothesis in a large sample of children in early puberty, to compare regional gray matter volumes among individuals with one (45X), two (typically developing 46XX females and 46XY males), and three (47XXY) sex chromosomes. Between-group contrasts of TS and KS groups relative to respective sex-matched controls demonstrated highly convergent patterns of volumetric differences with the presence of an additional sex chromosome being associated with relatively decreased parieto-occipital gray matter volume and relatively increased temporo-insular gray matter volumes. Furthermore, z-score map comparisons between TS and KS cohorts also suggested that this effect occurs in a linear dose-dependent fashion. We infer that sex chromosome gene expression directly influences brain structure in children during early stages of puberty, extending our understanding of genotype-phenotype mechanisms underlying sex differences in the brain.},

  abstract = {Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) is a statistical technique for detecting the social transmission of behavioural innovations in groups of animals, including humans. The strength of social transmission is inferred from the extent to which the diffusion (spread) of the innovation follows a social network. NBDA can have two goals: (a) to establish whether social transmission is occurring and how strong its effects are; and/or (b) to establish the typical pathways of information transfer. The technique has been used in a range of taxa, including primates, cetaceans, birds and fish, using a range of different types of network. Here I investigate the conceptual underpinnings of NBDA, in order to establish the meaning of results using different networks. I develop a model of the social transmission process where each individual observation of the target behaviour affects the rate at which the observer learns that behaviour. I then establish how NBDAs using different networks relate to this underlying process, and thus how we can interpret the results of each. My analysis shows that a different network or networks are appropriate depending on the specific goal or goals of the study, and establishes how the parameter estimates yielded from an NBDA can be interpreted for different networks.

  abstract = {Social network analysis has provided important insight into many population processes in wild animals. Constructing social networks requires quantifying the relationship between each pair of individuals in the population. Researchers often use association indices to convert observations into a measure of propensity for individuals to be seen together. At its simplest, this measure is just the probability of observing both individuals together given that one has been seen (the simple ratio index). However, this probability becomes more challenging to calculate if the detection rate for individuals is imperfect. We first evaluate the performance of existing association indices at estimating true association rates under scenarios where (1) only a proportion of all groups are observed (group location errors), (2) not all individuals are observed despite being present (individual location errors), and (3) a combination of the two. Commonly used methods aimed at dealing with incomplete observations perform poorly because they are based on arbitrary observation probabilities. We therefore derive complete indices that can be calibrated for the different types of incomplete observations to generate accurate estimates of association rates. These are provided in an R package that readily interfaces with existing routines. We conclude that using calibration data is an important step when constructing animal social networks, and that in their absence, researchers should use a simple estimator and explicitly consider the impact of this on their findings.}

Laboratory studies suggest that exposure to elevated noise can interfere with the development of a young animal's ability to process social signals and, ultimately, its ability to communicate as an adult. Whether such effects occur in nature is unknown, however. Here, we present the first field experiments examining whether elevated noise affects the development of the ability to discriminate the vocalizations of different conspecifics. We exposed nestling tree swallows to white noise during development, and then tested, in both quiet and noisy conditions, whether they could discriminate their parents' provisioning calls and their nestmates' begging calls from those of other individuals. We predicted that noise would interfere with discrimination, because previous work showed that it decreased nestling detection of adult calls, ostensibly an easier task. Instead, noise had no discernible effect on discrimination of parental and nestmate calls, even though it reduced overall responses to adult calls, as shown previously. While our results show no long-term disruptive effect of noise on development, they also show no adjustments to sustained noise that might help nestlings better cope with noisy conditions.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Their  conclusions are reached because (1) in comparison to males, females  orgasm less frequently during sex (the variation in female orgasm  rates [or ease of orgasm] is very high) and (2) levels of phenotypic  variation reveal the strength of selection on a character, and clitoral  variation is large relative to penis or vaginal variation (as measured  by the coefficients of variation [CV] in these traits). Point 1 is  a statement based on previous work, whereas for point 2 the authors  present and compare the CV for clitoral, vaginal, and penis length.  The authors suggest that these two points, and particularly the second,  support the notion that female orgasm is probably a pleiotropic effect  of selection on male orgasm; there is strong selection on male orgasm  and genetic correlations between the sexes mean that females orgasm  as a by-product of selection on males. Here I argue that the authors'  conclusions are equivocal and possibly incorrect, based largely on  misunderstandings of some fundamental evolutionary biology.},

Recent work has also shown that females of several bird species who directly observe males prefer those that can solve a novel foraging task over those that cannot. In addition to or instead of direct observation of cognitive skills, many species utilize assessment signals when choosing a mate. Here, we test whether females can select a problem-solving male over a non-solving male when presented only with a signal known to be used in mate assessment: song. Using an operant conditioning assay, we compared female zebra finch (\emph{Taeniopygia guttata}) preference for the songs of males that could quickly solve a novel foraging task to the songs of males that could not solve the task. Females were never housed with the test subject males whose song they heard, and the only information provided about the males was their song. We found that females elicited more songs of problem-solving males than of non-solvers, indicating that song may contain information about a male's ability to solve a novel foraging task and that na\"ive females prefer the songs of problem-solving males.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

A long-term field study to investigate the population dynamics and social behavior of 7-16 troops of free-ranging Formosan macaques at Mt. Longevity, Taiwan has been conducted since July 1993. Between Dec. 1994 and Dec. 1997, a systematic census was conducted on a biweekly basis to record data on the demography of Formosan macaques. We used focal animal sampling and ad libitum sampling twice per week in respective troops to record data on social behavior including male replacement and fission processes. The maximum density of macaques has been estimated as 26 individuals per km2 in Oct. 1997. The average troop size was 26.1 {$\pm$} 9.7 (n = 7) in Jan. 1995 and it reached the highest level of 47.0 {$\pm$} 21.2 (n = 13) in Aug. 1997. Two cases of fission were observed. The branch troops, Ia and Aa, that were formed as a result of fission had the smallest size with 9 individuals in the beginning, while troop I had the largest size of 86 individuals. Births were recorded mainly between Apr. and June (97\%) with a peak in mid-Apr. to mid-May. The annual average overall sex ratio was 1.06 {$\pm$} 0.28, while the adult sex ratio (adult males to adult females) was 0.53 {$\pm$}0.12. The average tenure length of alpha males was 16.8 {$\pm$} 18.9 mo (n = 34) and ranged from 1 wk to a maximum of 6 yr. The average alpha male tenure in newly formed troops was significantly shorter (p {$<$} 0.01) than that in the remaining troops. About 88\% of alpha male changes occurred between Oct. and Feb., which paralleled the peak and the end of the mating season, respectively.},

Recent consensus views cranial morphology as largely indicative of population history in humans, with some anatomical cranial regions/measurements being more informative on population history, while others being under selection pressure. We test earlier findings using the largest and most diverse cranial dataset available as yet: 7,423 male specimens from 135 geographic human population samples represented by 33 standard craniometric linear measurements. We calculated Mahalanobis D(2) for three datasets: complete cranial dataset; facial measurement dataset; and neurocranial measurement dataset; these morphological distance matrices were then compared to matrices of geographic distances as well as of several climatic variables. Additionally, we calculated Fst values for our cranial measurements and compared the results to the expected Fst values for neutral genetic loci. Our findings support the hypothesis that cranial, and especially neurocranial morphology, is phylogenetically informative, and that aspects of the face and cranium are subject to selection related to climatic factors. The Fst analysis suggest that selection to climate is largely restricted to groups living in extremely cold environments, including Northeast Asia, North America, and Northern Europe, though each of these regions appears to have arrived at their morphology through distinct adaptive pathways.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY 1. The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimu-lating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be cate-gorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour coded. 2. Evidence is presented for at least two independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface to white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to the orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye preference. The ocular dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent. 3. There is a tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction and cells favouring the other. 4. A horizontal organization corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned. The upper layers (II and the upper two-thirds of III) contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually absent. The cells are mostly binocularly driven. Simple cells are found deep in layer III, and in IV A and IV B. In layer IV B they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells are rare.

  abstract = {Oscine songbirds are an ideal system for investigating how early experience affects behavior. Young songbirds face a challenging task: how to recognize and selectively learn only their own species' song, often during a time-limited window. Because birds are capable of hearing birdsong very early in life, early exposure to song could plausibly affect recognition of appropriate models; however, this idea conflicts with the traditional view that song learning occurs only after a bird leaves the nest. Thus, it remains unknown whether natural variation in acoustic exposure prior to song learning affects the template for recognition. In a population where sister species, golden-crowned and white-crowned sparrows, breed syntopically, we found that nestlings discriminate between heterospecific and conspecific song playbacks prior to the onset of song memorization. We then asked whether natural exposure to more frequent or louder heterospecific song explained any variation in golden-crowned nestling response to heterospecific song playbacks. We characterized the amount of each species' song audible in golden-crowned sparrow nests and showed that even in a relatively small area, the ratio of heterospecific to conspecific song exposure varies widely. However, although many songbirds hear and respond to acoustic signals before fledging, golden-crowned sparrow nestlings that heard different amounts of heterospecific song did not behave differently in response to heterospecific playbacks. This study provides the first evidence that song discrimination at the onset of song learning is robust to the presence of closely related heterospecifics in nature, which may be an important adaptation in sympatry between potentially interbreeding taxa.}

  abstract = {Oscine songbirds have been an important study system for social learning, particularly because their learned songs provide an analog for human languages and music. Here, we propose a different analogy: from an evolutionary perspective, could birds' songs change over time more like arrowheads than arias? Small improvements to a bird's song can lead to large fitness differences for its singer, which could make songs more analogous to human tools than languages. We modify a model of human tool evolution to accommodate cultural evolution of birdsong: each song learner chooses the most skilled available tutor to emulate, and each is more likely to produce an inferior copy than a superior one. Similar to human tool evolution, our model suggests that larger populations of birds could foster improvements in song over time, even when learners restrict their pool of tutors to a subset of individuals in their social network. We also demonstrate that song elements could be simplified instead of lost after population bottlenecks if lower quality traits are easier to imitate than higher quality ones. We show that these processes could plausibly generate empirically observed patterns of song evolution for some song traits, and we make predictions about the types of song elements most likely to be lost when populations shrink. More broadly, we aim to connect the modeling approaches used in human and nonhuman systems, moving toward a cohesive theoretical framework that accounts for both cognitive and demographic processes.},

Despite their shared ancestry, mammalian Y chromosomes display enormous variation among species in size, gene content, and structural complexity. Several unique features of the Y chromosome-its lack of a homologous partner for crossing over, its functional specialization for spermatogenesis, and its high degree of sequence amplification-contribute to this extreme variation. However, amid this evolutionary turmoil many commonalities have been revealed that have contributed to our understanding of the selective pressures driving the evolution and biology of the Y chromosome. Two biological themes have defined Y-chromosome research over the past six decades: testis determination and spermatogenesis. A third biological theme begins to emerge from recent insights into the Y chromosome's roles beyond the reproductive tract-a theme that promises to broaden the reach of Y-chromosome research by shedding light on fundamental sex differences in human health and disease.

  abstract = {European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) learned to discriminate patterns of 2000-Hz tones organized into rhythmic as compared with random, arrhythmic temporal structures, and the perceptual processes underlying the discrimination were then analyzed. Two rhythmic patterns were constructed, for different birds, according to a linear rule in which tones and intertone intervals of equal duration alternated or according to a hierarchical rule in which two subpatterns alternated. The arrhythmic pattern was a sequence of tone and intertone intervals each of random duration. The birds were required to peck at one key in the presence of a rhythmic pattern and at another key in the presence of the arrhythmic pattern to obtain food reward. All birds learned the rhythmic\textendash arrhythmic discrimination, and discrimination accuracy was the same for both the linear and hierarchical rhythmic structures. In a series of transfer tests that followed, discrimination performance was tested when the temporal structure of the rhythmic stimulus patterns was transformed and when their pitch was shifted up or down an octave. For temporal transformations, performance was well maintained under (a) a log transformation which, from test to test, changed the absolute duration of tones and intertone intervals but kept their ratios constant (a simple tempo transformation); (b) an additive transformation which kept either tone duration or intertone interval constant from test to test while their counterparts changed in duration; and (c) a pattern interchange in which, for the appropriate birds, the linear was substituted for the hierarchical pattern, or the hierarchical was substituted for the linear pattern. Performance deteriorated (but remained above chance), however, when rhythmic patterns were degraded by holding tone (or intertone) duration constant while intertone (or tone) durations varied randomly within a test session. Performance was also well maintained when the baseline temporal patterns were shifted an octave in pitch, but the data do not necessarily force the conclusion that the birds showed true octave generalization. The results suggest the birds solved the rhythmic\textendash arrhythmic discrimination on the basis of a nominal, qualitative pattern attribute, rhythmicity. Patterns are high in rhythmicity if pattern components are of constant duration within a test session, and if they reoccur periodically. Rhythmicity deteriorates as pattern components vary in duration within a test session and reoccur at varying time intervals. The results also show that the human capacity for discrimination among complex temporal patterns of sound is shared with at least one other species and may, therefore, represent a perceptual process that is\textemdash within limits yet to be determined\textemdash phylogenetically general.},

  abstract = {Spanish speaking populations in the USA have long been categorised under the umbrella term `Hispanic', which is a cultural construct. The term Hispanic ignores the unique ethnohistories and biological variation among Hispanic groups with various European, African and indigenous American influences. Considerable heterogeneity has been identified in pre-contact America and has continued to influence the cultural and biological compositions of various regions today. The purpose of this research is to examine biological variation in Mexico, which was influenced by indigenous migration patterns and the Old World conquests of the Americans. Using multivariate statistics, this paper compares 16 three-dimensional craniometric landmarks of samples from northern Central Mexico, northern Yucatan and western Mexico to examine the regional biological variation present in Mexico in both prehistoric and historic groups and also compares Mexican, Spanish and African American groups to examine patterns of Old World conquests. Multivariate statistics detected significant group differences for both size and shape (centroid size, p {$<$} 0.0001; shape, p {$<$} 0.0001) and showed that while significantly different, all the Mexican groups are more similar to one another except for one prehistoric inland-western Mexican group, which is morphologically distinct from the other Mexican groups. Previous mtDNA research in these areas shows a low prevalence of African American admixture and a high indigenous component in the northern Mexican groups, which is consistent with the findings of this paper. The prehistoric and historic Mexican groups were the most similar indicating the retention of indigenous admixture after contact. The results from this analysis demonstrate that all groups are significantly different from one another supporting other findings that have shown that the indigenous populations of the New World are heterogeneous and that this variation may also contribute to the heterogeneity of contemporary populations.

  abstract = {(1) We recorded the territorial songs of great tits at ten different geographically separated sites. Five of the sites were in dense deciduous or coniferous forest, and five in open woodland, parkland or hedgerows. (2) Forest birds from England, Poland, Sweden, Norway and Morocco had songs with a lower maximum frequency, narrower frequency range and fewer notes per phrase than woodland birds from England, Iran, Greece, Spain and Morocco. (3) We also measured acoustic attenuation for each habitat type; and for each study site we noted; body size of the birds, tree density, territory size, song of other species, song perch height, temperature and humidity. (4) We suggest that the differences in song between habitats, and striking similarities of songs from the same habitat type are at least in part related to differences in acoustic attenuation and territory size. Birds living in dense forests have to broadcast songs through more vegetation and over greater distances than do woodland birds. (5) We conclude that differences between habitats in climate, body size, perch height, and acoustic competition from other species are unimiportant in accounting for the observed differences in song. (6) If it is accepted that forest songs are better suited for long distance transmission, we cannot explain why woodland birds use less well designed songs, although we offer some suggestions.

  abstract = {Predictable behaviour (or `behavioural stability') might be favoured in certain ecological contexts, for example when representing a quality signal. Costs associated with producing stable phenotypes imply selection should favour plasticity in stability when beneficial. Repeatable among-individual differences in degree of stability are simultaneously expected if individuals differ in ability to pay these costs, or in how they resolve cost\textendash benefit trade-offs. Bird song represents a prime example, where stability may be costly yet beneficial when stable singing is a quality signal favoured by sexual selection. Assuming energetic costs, ecological variation (e.g. in food availability) should result in both within- and among-individual variation in stability. If song stability represents a quality signal, we expect directional selection favouring stable singers. For a 3-year period, we monitored 12 nest box plots of great tits Parus major during breeding. We recorded male songs during simulated territory intrusions, twice during their mate's laying stage and twice during incubation. Each preceding winter, we manipulated food availability. Assuming that stability is costly, we expected food-supplemented males to sing more stable songs. We also expected males to sing more stable songs early in the breeding season (when paternity is not decided) and stable singers to have increased reproductive success. We found strong support for plasticity in stability for two key song characteristics: minimum frequency and phrase length. Males were plastic because they became more stable over the season, contrary to expectations. Food supplementation did not affect body condition but increased stability in minimum frequency. This treatment effect occurred only in 1 year, implying that food supplementation affected stability only in interaction with (unknown) year-specific ecological factors. We found no support for directional, correlational or fluctuating selection on the stability in minimum frequency (i.e. the song trait whose stability exhibited cross-year repeatability): stable singers did not have higher reproductive success. Our findings imply that stability in minimum frequency is not a fitness quality indicator unless males enjoy fitness benefits via pathways not studied here. Future studies should thus address the mechanisms shaping and maintaining individual repeatability of song stability in the wild.},

But at a higher level of organization\textemdash the bout\textemdash zebra finch song is no longer stereotyped. Song bouts include several repetitions of the motif, which are often linked by a variable number of short ``connector'' vocalizations. In this conceptual methods paper, we show that combinatorial analysis alone yields an incomplete description of this bout-level structure. In contrast, studying birdsong as a time-varying analog signal can reveal patterns of flexibility in the rhythmic organization of song bouts. Visualizing large song-samples in sorted raster plots shows that motifs are strung together via two distinct categories of connections: tight or loose. Loose connections allow considerable timing variation across renditions. Even among co-tutored birds that acquired similar motifs, we observe strong individual variability in rhythms and temporal plasticity of song bouts. These findings suggest that vocal flexibility could potentially allow individuals to express a variety of behavioral states through their songs, even in species that sing only a single stereotyped motif.},

The severe and predominantly psychological form of PMS is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The exact aetiology of PMS is not known. PMS results from ovulation and appears to be caused by the progesterone produced following ovulation in women who have enhanced sensitivity to this progesterone. The increased sensitivity may be due to neurotransmitter (mainly serotonin) dysfunction. The key diagnostic feature is that the symptoms must be absent in the time between the end of menstruation and ovulation. Prospective symptom rating charts are used for this purpose. Treatment is achieved by suppression of ovulation or reducing progesterone sensitivity with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. In this chapter, the authors describe the aetiology, symptoms, diagnosis and evidence-based management of premenstrual syndrome.},

  abstract = {Sex differences in human behavior show adaptive complementarity: Males have better motor and spatial abilities, whereas females have superior memory and social cognition skills. Studies also show sex differences in human brains but do not explain this complementarity. In this work, we modeled the structural connectome using diffusion tensor imaging in a sample of 949 youths (aged 8-22 y, 428 males and 521 females) and discovered unique sex differences in brain connectivity during the course of development. Connection-wise statistical analysis, as well as analysis of regional and global network measures, presented a comprehensive description of network characteristics. In all supratentorial regions, males had greater within-hemispheric connectivity, as well as enhanced modularity and transitivity, whereas between-hemispheric connectivity and cross-module participation predominated in females. However, this effect was reversed in the cerebellar connections. Analysis of these changes developmentally demonstrated differences in trajectory between males and females mainly in adolescence and in adulthood. Overall, the results suggest that male brains are structured to facilitate connectivity between perception and coordinated action, whereas female brains are designed to facilitate communication between analytical and intuitive processing modes.},

While asserting a principle of continuity between human populations \& their evolutionary antecedents, they also posit a point of origin from which separate processes of culture \& history rise up from a universal baseline of evolved human nature. But the belief in this nature rests on a confusion surrounding the notion of genetic information. Human capacities are not genetically pre-specified but emerge within processes of ontogenetic development that are at once historical \& evolutionary. Replacing the "population thinking" of the Darwinian paradigm with a "relational thinking" that focuses on the dynamics of developmental systems leads us to a new vision of anthropology, as a science of engagement in a relational world. 29 References.

The concept of nature is thus inherently political. In reality, human beings do not dwell on the other side of a boundary between society and nature but in the same world that is inhabited by creatures of all kinds, human and non-human. Can a dwelling perspective, then, be combined with the recognition that human lives are lived collectively within fields of power? Is human History necessarily distinguished from the history of non-humans on the grounds that only the former involves the reproduction of power relations in the production of Society? The paper argues that there are not two kinds of history but one, comprised by the interplay of diverse human and non-human agents in their mutual relations. The infliction of pain and suffering is not limited to relations among humans. Like other creatures, humans adopt various means to protect themselves. In so doing, they create places. Ultimately, how- ever, the protection of place and the protection of nature are incompatible. The politics of dwelling lie in this incompatibility and the struggles it entails.},

That \textexclamdown s to say, it scarcely deals with the phenomenon of light. lt is rather about the relations between objects. images and their \textexclamdown nterpretations. A study of aunl culture, built alonq the same lines, would be about the \textexclamdown nterpretat\textexclamdown on of a world of things rendered in their acoustic forms. lt has become conventional to describe such a world by means of the concept of soundscape. Undoubtedly when it was first \textexclamdown ntroduced, the concept served a useful rhetorical purpose in dnwing attention to a sensory register that had been neglected relative to sight. I believe however that it has now outlived its usefulness. More to the point. it carries the risk that we might lose touch with sound in just the same way that visual studies have lost touch with light. ln what follows I will set out four reasons why I th\textexclamdown nk the concept of soundscape lvould be better abandoned. First, the environment that we experience, know and move around in is not sliced up along the lines of the sensory pathways by which we enter into it. The world we perceive is the some world, whatever path we take, and each of us perceives it as an undivided centre of activity and awareness. For this reason I deplore the fash\textexclamdown on for multiplying -scopes of every possible kind. The power of the prototypical concept of landscape lies precisely in the fact that it is not tied to any specific sensory reg\textexclamdown ster -whether vision, hearing, touch, smell or whatever. ln ordinary perceptual practice these registers cooper\textquestiondown te so closely, and w\textexclamdown th such overlap of function, that their respect\textexclamdown ve contributions are impossible to tease apart. The landscape is of course visible, bul it only becomes visuol when \textexclamdown t has been rendered by some technique, such as of paint\textexclamdown ng or photography, which then allows it to be viewed indirectly, by way of the resulting image which, as \textexclamdown t were, retu\'Ins the landscape back to the viewer in an artificially purified form, shorn of all other sensory dimensions. Likewise, a landscape may be oudible, but to be ourol it would have to have been first rendered by a technique of sound art or recording, such that it can be ployed bockwiThin an environment (such as a darkened room) in which we are otherwise deprived of sensory stimulus. We should not be fooled by art historians and other students of visual culture who write books about the history of seeing that are entirely about the contemplation of images. Their conceit is to imagine that the eyes are not so much organs of observation as \textexclamdown nstruments of playback, lodged in the image rather than the body of the observer. lt is as though the eyes did our seeing for us, leaving us to (re)view the images they relay to our consciousness. For the active looking and watching that people do as they go about their business, visual theorists have subst\textexclamdown tuted regimes of the 'scopic', defined and distingu\`ished by the recording and playback functions of these allegorical eyes. Although the apparent etymological kinship between the scopic and the 'scapes' of our perception is spurious ('scape' is actually derived from the Dutch schop, cognate with the English suffix'-ship'. refening to a fellowship or community of},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

Calls, which are used by both sexes throughout the year, and songs, which are sung primarily by breeding males, differ distinctly between two distinct Siberian forms. Through a ring of southern populations that connect the northern forms, signal divergence is correlated with both geographic distance and genetic divergence. Calls and songs differ in their particular patterns of geographic variation, probably because of the larger influence of sexual selection on songs than on calls. These patterns are supportive of neither acoustic adaptation nor morphology being major drivers of divergence in vocalizations. Rather, these results support the importance of stochastic evolution of communication systems in the evolution of new species. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Authors.},

Using identical stimuli to isolate perceptual from judgmental processes, the 2 judgment types were operationalized by employing symmetry and aesthetic judgments. Electrophysiological activity was recorded while 12 university student participants viewed newly designed 2-dimensional patterns in a pre-cued task setting. Judgment analyses of a Phase I test and performance in the main experiment revealed detailed paramorphic models of the individual judges' cognitive systems as well as group models. Symmetry showed a strong positive correlation with judgments and was the most important cue in every case. Descriptive judgments were performed faster than evaluative judgments. The ERPs revealed a phasic frontal negativity in the non-aesthetic condition as well as a sustained posterior negativity in the symmetrical condition. All conditions showed late positive potentials (LPPs). Evaluative judgment LPPs revealed a more pronounced right lateralization. It was concluded that descriptive symmetry judgment and evaluative aesthetic judgment processes differ dramatically and recruit, at least in part, different neural machinery.

Moreover, Amazonian          and US reproductions both deteriorated for high-frequency tones even though they were          fully audible. But whereas US participants tended to reproduce notes an integer number          of octaves above or below the heard tones, Amazonians did not, ignoring the note "chroma"          (C, D, etc.). Chroma matching in US participants was more pronounced in US musicians          than non-musicians, was not affected by feedback, and was correlated with similarity-based          measures of octave equivalence as well as the ability to match the absolute f0 of          a stimulus in the singing range. The results suggest the cross-cultural presence of          logarithmic scales for pitch, and biological constraints on the limits of pitch, but          indicate that octave equivalence may be culturally contingent, plausibly dependent          on pitch representations that develop from experience with particular musical systems.}

Priors measured in members of a native Amazonian society were distinct from those in US participants but also featured integer ratio peaks. The results do not preclude biological constraints favoring integer ratios, but they suggest that priors on musical rhythm are substantially modulated by experience and may simply reflect the empirical distribution of rhythm that listeners encounter.

The results do not preclude biological constraints favoring integer ratios, but they suggest that priors on musical rhythm are substantially modulated by experience and may simply reflect the empirical distribution of rhythm that listeners encounter. The proposed method can efficiently map out a high-resolution view of biases that shape transmission and stability of simple reproducible patterns within a culture.},

We measured a signature of mental representations of rhythm in 923 participants from 39 participant groups in 15 countries across 5 continents, spanning urban societies, indigenous populations, and online participants. Listeners reproduced random ``seed'' rhythms; their reproductions were fed back as the stimulus (as in the game of ``telephone''), such that their biases (the prior) could be estimated from the distribution of reproductions. Every tested group showed a prior with peaks at integer ratio rhythms, suggesting that discrete rhythm ``categories'' at small integer ratios are universal. The occurrence and relative importance of different integer ratio categories varied across groups, often reflecting local musical systems. However, university students and online participants in non-Western countries tended to resemble Western participants, underrepresenting the variability otherwise evident across cultures. The results suggest the universality of discrete mental representations of music while showing their interaction with culture-specific traditions.},

  abstract = {Temporal regularities in speech, such as interdependencies in the timing of speech events, are thought to scaffold early acquisition of the building blocks in speech. By providing on-line clues to the location and duration of upcoming syllables, temporal structure may aid segmentation and clustering of continuous speech into separable units. This hypothesis tacitly assumes that learners exploit predictability in the temporal structure of speech. Existing measures of speech timing tend to focus on first-order regularities among adjacent units, and are overly sensitive to idiosyncrasies in the data they describe. Here, we compare several statistical methods on a sample of 18 languages, testing whether syllable occurrence is predictable over time. Rather than looking for differences between languages, we aim to find across languages (using clearly defined acoustic, rather than orthographic, measures), temporal predictability in the speech signal which could be exploited by a language learner. First, we analyse distributional regularities using two novel techniques: a Bayesian ideal learner analysis, and a simple distributional measure. Second, we model higher-order temporal structure-regularities arising in an ordered series of syllable timings-testing the hypothesis that non-adjacent temporal structures may explain the gap between subjectively-perceived temporal regularities, and the absence of universally-accepted lower-order objective measures. Together, our analyses provide limited evidence for predictability at different time scales, though higher-order predictability is difficult to reliably infer. We conclude that temporal predictability in speech may well arise from a combination of individually weak perceptual cues at multiple structural levels, but is challenging to pinpoint.},

These two groups of tunes were compared using 83 statistical summary and corpus-based melodic features and automated classification techniques. INMI tunes were found to have more common global melodic contours and less common average gradients between melodic turning points than non-INMI tunes, in relation to a large pop music corpus. INMI tunes also displayed faster average tempi than non-INMI tunes. Results are discussed in relation to literature on INMI, musical memory, and melodic ``catchiness''.},

  abstract = {Expressive communication in the arts often involves deviations from stylistic norms, which can increase the aesthetic evaluation of an artwork or performance. The detection and appreciation of such expressive deviations may be amplified by cultural familiarity and expertise of the observer. One form of expressive communication in music is playing ``out of time,'' including asynchrony (deviations from synchrony between different instruments) and non-isochrony (deviations from equal spacing between subsequent note onsets or metric units). As previous research has provided somewhat conflicting perspectives on the degree to which deviations from synchrony and isochrony are aesthetically relevant, we aimed to shed new light on this topic by accounting for the effects of listeners' cultural familiarity and expertise. We manipulated (a)synchrony and (non-)isochrony separately in excerpts from three groove-based musical styles (jazz, candombe, and jembe), using timings from real performances. We recruited musician and non-musician participants (N~=~176) from three countries (UK, Uruguay, and Mali), selected to vary in their prior experience of hearing and performing these three styles. Participants completed both an aesthetic preference rating task and a perceptual discrimination task for the stimuli. Our results indicate an overall preference toward synchrony in these styles, but culturally contingent, expertise-dependent preferences for deviations from isochrony. This suggests that temporal processing relies on mechanisms that vary in their dependence on low-level and high-level perception, and emphasizes the role of cultural familiarity and expertise in shaping aesthetic preferences.},

  abstract = {Biological predispositions in vocal learning have been proposed to underlie commonalities in vocal sequences, including for speech and birdsong, but cultural propagation could also account for such commonalities [1\textendash 4]. Songbirds such as the zebra finch learn the sequencing of their acoustic elements (``syllables'') during development [5\textendash 8]. Zebra finches are not constrained to learn a specific sequence of syllables, but significant consistencies in the positioning and sequencing of syllables have been observed between individuals within populations and between populations [8\textendash 10]. To reveal biological predispositions in vocal sequence learning, we individually tutored juvenile zebra finches with randomized and unbiased sequences of syllables and analyzed the extent to which birds produced common sequences. In support of biological predispositions, birds tutored with randomized sequences produced songs with striking similarities. Birds preferentially started and ended their song sequence with particular syllables, consistently positioned shorter and higher frequency syllables in the middle of their song, and sequenced their syllables such that pitch alternated across adjacent syllables. These patterns are reminiscent of those observed in normally tutored birds, suggesting that birds ``creolize'' aberrant sequence inputs to produce normal sequence outputs. Similar patterns were also observed for syllables that were not used for tutoring (i.e., unlearned syllables), suggesting that motor biases could contribute to sequence learning biases. Furthermore, zebra finches spontaneously produced acoustic patterns that are commonly observed in speech and music, suggesting that sensorimotor processes that are shared across a wide range of vertebrates could underlie these patterns in humans. James and Sakata reveal that naive zebra finches individually tutored with randomized acoustic sequences produce convergent acoustic patterns that are non-random and similar to those observed in wild finch song and in speech and music. Their data demonstrate that learning biases contribute to commonalities in acoustic patterning.},

For example, surveys of laboratory and wild populations of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) document consistent patterning of vocal elements (``syllables'') with respect to their acoustic properties (e.g., duration, mean frequency). Furthermore, such universal patterns are also produced by birds that are experimentally tutored with songs containing randomly sequenced syllables (``tutored birds''). Despite extensive demonstrations of learning biases, much remains to be uncovered about the nature of biological predispositions that bias song learning and production in songbirds. Here, we examined the degree to which ``innate'' auditory templates and/or biases in vocal motor production contribute to vocal learning biases and production in zebra finches. Such contributions can be revealed by examining acoustic patterns in the songs of birds raised without sensory exposure to song (``untutored birds'') or of birds that are unable to hear from early in development (``early-deafened birds''). We observed that untutored zebra finches and early-deafened zebra finches produce songs with positional variation in some acoustic features (e.g., mean frequency) that resemble universal patterns observed in tutored birds. Similar to tutored birds, early-deafened birds also produced song motifs with alternation in acoustic features across adjacent syllables. That universal acoustic patterns are observed in the songs of both untutored and early-deafened birds highlights the contribution motor production biases to the emergence of universals in culturally transmitted behaviors.},

While the learning of the acoustic structure of syllables has been extensively studied, relatively little is known about sequence learning in songbirds. Statistical learning could contribute to the acquisition of vocal sequences, and we investigated the nature and extent of sequence learning at various levels of song organization in the Bengalese finch, Lonchura striata var. domestica. We found that, under semi-natural conditions, pupils (sons) significantly reproduced the sequence statistics of their tutor's (father's) songs at multiple levels of organization (e.g., syllable repertoire, prevalence, and transitions). For example, the probability of syllable transitions at ``branch points'' (relatively complex sequences that are followed by multiple types of transitions) were significantly correlated between the songs of tutors and pupils. We confirmed the contribution of learning to sequence similarities between fathers and sons by experimentally tutoring juvenile Bengalese finches with the songs of unrelated tutors. We also discovered that the extent and fidelity of sequence similarities between tutors and pupils were significantly predicted by the prevalence of sequences in the tutor's song and that distinct types of sequence modifications (e.g., syllable additions or deletions) followed distinct patterns. Taken together, these data provide compelling support for the role of statistical learning in vocal production learning and identify factors that could modulate the extent of vocal sequence learning.},

In this study we investigated the influence of vocal and instrumental background music on verbal learning.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: 226 subjects were randomly assigned to one of five groups (one control group and 4 experimental groups). All participants were exposed to a verbal learning task. One group served as control group while the 4 further groups served as experimental groups. The control group learned without background music while the 4 experimental groups were exposed to vocal or instrumental musical pieces during learning with different subjective intensity and valence. Thus, we employed 4 music listening conditions (vocal music with high intensity: VOC\{\_\}HIGH, vocal music with low intensity: VOC\{\_\}LOW, instrumental music with high intensity: INST\{\_\}HIGH, instrumental music with low intensity: INST\{\_\}LOW) and one control condition (CONT) during which the subjects learned the word lists. Since it turned out that the high and low intensity groups did not differ in terms of the rated intensity during the main experiment these groups were lumped together. Thus, we worked with 3 groups: one control group and two groups, which were exposed to background music (vocal and instrumental) during verbal learning. As dependent variable, the number of learned words was used. Here we measured immediate recall during five learning sessions (recall 1 - recall 5) and delayed recall for 15 minutes (recall 6) and 14 days (recall 7) after the last learning session.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Verbal learning improved during the first 5 recall sessions without any strong difference between the control and experimental groups. Also the delayed recalls were similar for the three groups. There was only a trend for attenuated verbal learning for the group passively listened to vocals. This learning attenuation diminished during the following learning sessions.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: The exposure to vocal or instrumental background music during encoding did not influence verbal learning. We suggest that the participants are easily able to cope with this background stimulation by ignoring this information channel in order to focus on the verbal learning task.},

We hypothesize that theories on melody recall may predict variation, and as such, investigate phrase length, the position and number of repetitions of a given phrase in the melody in which it occurs, as well as expectancy and motif repetivity. We show that all of these predictors account for the observed variation to a moderate degree, and that, as hypothesized, those phrases vary less which are rather short, contain highly expected melodic material, occur relatively early in the melody, and contain small pitch intervals. A large portion of the variance is left unexplained by the current model, however, which leads us to a discussion of future approaches to study memorability of melodies.},

The present study compares several such similarity measures from different music research domains: correlation distance, city block distance, Euclidean distance, local alignment, wavelet transform and structure induction.

In particular, the combination of social media filters and recommender systems can lead to the emergence of polarized and fragmented groups. In some social contexts, such segregation processes of human groups have been shown to share similarities with phase separation phenomena in physics. Here, we study the impact of information filtering on collective segregation behaviour of human groups. We report a series of experiments where groups of 22 subjects have to perform a collective segregation task that mimics the tendency of individuals to bond with other similar individuals. More precisely, the participants are each assigned a colour (red or blue) unknown to them, and have to regroup with other subjects sharing the same colour. To assist them, they are equipped with an artificial sensory device capable of detecting the majority colour in their 'environment' (defined as their \emph{k} nearest neighbours, unbeknownst to them), for which we control the perception range, \emph{k} = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13. We study the separation dynamics (emergence of unicolour groups) and the properties of the final state, and show that the value of \emph{k} controls the quality of the segregation, although the subjects are totally unaware of the precise definition of the 'environment'. We also find that there is a perception range \emph{k} = 7 above which the ability of the group to segregate does not improve. We introduce a model that precisely describes the random motion of a group of pedestrians in a confined space, and which faithfully reproduces and allows interpretation of the results of the segregation experiments. Finally, we discuss the strong and precise analogy between our experiment and the phase separation of two immiscible materials at very low temperature.}

In humans cumulative cultural evolution is thought to depend on a unique suite of cognitive abilities, including teaching, language and imitation. Tool-making New Caledonian crows show some hallmarks of cumulative culture; but this claim is contentious, in part because these birds do not appear to imitate. One alternative hypothesis is that crows' tool designs could be culturally transmitted through a process of mental template matching. That is, individuals could use or observe conspecifics' tools, form a mental template of a particular tool design, and then reproduce this in their own manufacture \textendash{} a process analogous to birdsong learning. Here, we provide the first evidence supporting this hypothesis, by demonstrating that New Caledonian crows have the cognitive capacity for mental template matching. Using a novel manufacture paradigm, crows were first trained to drop paper into a vending machine to retrieve rewards. They later learnt that only items of a particular size (large or small templates) were rewarded. At test, despite being rewarded at random, and with no physical templates present, crows manufactured items that were more similar in size to previously rewarded, than unrewarded, templates. Our results provide the first evidence that this cognitive ability may underpin the transmission of New Caledonian crows' natural tool designs.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Ungulate migrations are assumed to stem from learning and cultural transmission of information regarding seasonal distribution of forage, but this hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We compared the migratory propensities of bighorn sheep and moose translocated into novel habitats with those of historical populations that had persisted for hundreds of years. Whereas individuals from historical populations were largely migratory, translocated individuals initially were not. After multiple decades, however, translocated populations gained knowledge about surfing green waves of forage (tracking plant phenology) and increased their propensity to migrate. Our findings indicate that learning and cultural transmission are the primary mechanisms by which ungulate migrations evolve. Loss of migration will therefore expunge generations of knowledge about the locations of high-quality forage and likely suppress population abundance.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Many animals exhibit an astonishing ability to form groups of large numbers of individuals. The dynamic properties of such groups have been the subject of intensive investigation. The actual grouping processes and underlying neural mechanisms, however, remain elusive. Here, we established a social clustering paradigm in \emph{Drosophila} to investigate the principles governing social group formation. Fruit flies spontaneously assembled into a stable cluster mimicking a distributed network. Social clustering was exhibited as a highly dynamic process including all individuals, which participated in stochastic pair-wise encounters mediated by appendage touches. Depriving sensory inputs resulted in abnormal encounter responses and a high failure rate of cluster formation. Furthermore, the social distance of the emergent network was regulated by \emph{ppk}-specific neurons, which were activated by contact-dependent social grouping. Taken together, these findings revealed the development of an orderly social structure from initially unorganised individuals via collective actions.}

  abstract = {Songs of many songbird species consist of variable sequences of a finite number of syllables. A common approach for characterizing the syntax of these complex syllable sequences is to use transition probabilities between the syllables. This is equivalent to the Markov model, in which each syllable is associated with one state, and the transition probabilities between the states do not depend on the state transition history. Here we analyze the song syntax in Bengalese finch. We show that the Markov model fails to capture the statistical properties of the syllable sequences. Instead, a state transition model that accurately describes the statistics of the syllable sequences includes adaptation of the self-transition probabilities when states are revisited consecutively, and allows associations of more than one state to a given syllable. Such a model does not increase the model complexity significantly. Mathematically, the model is a partially observable Markov model with adaptation (POMMA). The success of the POMMA supports the branching chain network model of how syntax is controlled within the premotor song nucleus HVC, but also suggests that adaptation and many-to-one mapping from the syllable-encoding chain networks in HVC to syllables should be included in the network model. \textcopyright{} 2011 Jin, Kozhevnikov.},

However, there has been little research on changes in this behaviour in songbirds across the breeding season. In this study, we followed changes in the dear enemy effect during the breeding season in Great Tits, Parus major. We simulated neighbour and stranger intrusions at three breeding stages corresponding to key ecological and social situations, egg-laying, incubation and nestling stages, and examined the territorial songs and physical responses of territory owners. Our results suggest that neighbours are dear enemies in the egg-laying and incubation stages, when territories are stable, but not at the nestling stage when territories become unstable. In addition, physical responses were more effective as warning signals than territorial songs when dear enemy effects were expressed. We conclude that the dear enemy effect is expressed flexibly, rather than in a fixed way, by territorial male Great Tits in our study area.},

  abstract = {Whereas a categorical difference in the genitals has always been acknowledged, the question of how far these categories extend into human biology is still not resolved. Documented sex/gender differ- ences in the brain are often taken as support of a sexually dimorphic view of human brains (``female brain'' or ``male brain''). However, such a distinction would be possible only if sex/gender differences in brain features were highly dimorphic (i.e., little overlap between the forms of these features in males and females) and internally consistent (i.e., a brain has only ``male'' or only ``female'' features). Here, analysis of MRIs of more than 1,400 human brains from four datasets reveals extensive overlap between the distributions of females and males for all gray matter,whitematter, and connections assessed.Moreover, analyses of internal consistency reveal that brains with features that are consistently at one end of the ``maleness-femaleness'' continuum are rare. Rather, most brains are comprised of unique ``mosaics'' of features, somemore common in females compared withmales, some more common inmales compared with females, and some common in both females and males. Our findings are robust across sample, age, type of MRI, andmethod of analysis. These findings are corroborated by a similar analysis of personality traits, attitudes, interests, and be- haviors of more than 5,500 individuals, which reveals that internal consistency is extremely rare. Our study demonstrates that, although there are sex/gender differences in the brain, human brains do not belong to one of two distinct categories: male brain/female brain.},

This was done in the wild, and so potential song tutors, territorial neighbours, potential mates and other social factors were all natural and not affected by the treatment. Normally, the song repertoires of the two species are completely discrete. However, the cross-fostered great tit males altered their song in several aspects, including repertoire size and composition, and temporal and frequency parameters, thus becoming intermediate between the normal songs of the two species. For the cross-fostered blue tit song, only repertoire composition was affected. However, an analysis of repertoire size in both species proved this to be larger in cross-fostered than in control males. This increase in repertoire size shows that repertoire size is influenced by social conditions in these species and is not strictly constrained by memory capacity. Furthermore, several of the cross-fostered great tit males included trilled songs in their repertoires. In these two species, trilled songs have been regarded as unique to the blue tit. In conclusion, our results show the importance of early social experiences for song learning in these wild tits. \textcopyright{} 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Hummingbirds have evolved to learn song from conspecifics independently of other bird clades that show this behaviour, such as parrots and oscine passerines. Little is known about how vocal learning occurs in hummingbirds. To determine the conditions necessary and sufficient for learning, we raised young Costa's hummingbirds, {$<$}em{$>$}Calypte costae{$<$}/em{$>$}, in isolation in two experiments. The first experiment tested whether three pairs of males, raised either in silence or with only acoustic exposure to song, would produce wild-type song. They did not: each pair instead produced 'isolate' songs dissimilar to wild-type song. Each pair produced a unique isolate song with subtle differences from other pairs. Thus, exposure to song alone is insufficient to trigger learning. The second experiment tested whether individually housed males would learn songs when exposed to a live male model plus playback of song (1 h/day, 3 days/week, for 3 months). Seven of eight birds that heard Costa's-like songs learned to sing their tutor song. Each individual produced song that matched idiosyncratic features of the individual songs played to them, demonstrating attention to, and learning of the exact acoustic stimuli received. Two control birds exposed to acoustically dissimilar Anna's hummingbird, {$<$}em{$>$}Calypte anna,{$<$}/em{$>$} song developed isolate song. Thus, exposure to species-specific song with a conspecific male is sufficient to trigger learning. The sensory phase began after fledging, around 23 days posthatch, and the sensorimotor phase began around 50 days posthatch, when singing also began. Song crystallization occurred approximately 125 days posthatch. Costa's also appear to be statistical learners; they learn to sing the songs they hear most often. Hummingbird song ontogeny appears to be similar to song ontogeny in passerines, despite its convergent origin.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

Consequently, attractiveness judgements are likely to reflect judgements of apparent health. One physical characteristic that may inform health judgements is fluctuating asymmetry as it may act as a visual marker for genetic quality and developmental stability. Consistent with these suggestions, a number of studies have found relationships between facial symmetry and facial attractiveness. In Study 1, the interplay between facial symmetry, attractiveness, and judgements of apparent health was explored within a partial correlation design. Findings suggest that the attractiveness-symmetry relationship is mediated by a link between judgements of apparent health and facial symmetry. In Study 2, an opposite-sex bias in sensitivity to facial symmetry was observed when judging health. Thus, perceptual analysis of symmetry may be an adaptation facilitating discrimination between potential mates on the basis of apparent health. The findings of both studies are consistent with a "good genes" explanation of the attractiveness-symmetry relationship and problematic for the claim that symmetry is attractive as a by-product of the ease with which the visual recognition system processes symmetric stimuli. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Key questions in the debate on the origin of such behaviour are whether this innovation is restricted to Homo sapiens, and whether it has a uniquely African origin. Here we report on a fossil freshwater shell assemblage from the Hauptknochenschicht ('main bone layer') of Trinil (Java, Indonesia), the type locality of Homo erectus discovered by Eug\`ene Dubois in 1891 (refs 2 and 3). In the Dubois collection (in the Naturalis museum, Leiden, The Netherlands) we found evidence for freshwater shellfish consumption by hominins, one unambiguous shell tool, and a shell with a geometric engraving. We dated sediment contained in the shells with (40)Ar/(39)Ar and luminescence dating methods, obtaining a maximum age of 0.54~{$\pm~$}0.10 million years and a minimum age of 0.43~{$\pm~$}0.05 million years. This implies that the Trinil Hauptknochenschicht is younger than previously estimated. Together, our data indicate that the engraving was made by Homo erectus, and that it is considerably older than the oldest geometric engravings described so far. Although it is at present not possible to assess the function or meaning of the engraved shell, this discovery suggests that engraving abstract patterns was in the realm of Asian Homo erectus cognition and neuromotor control.},

Longitudinal studies of bird song across many generations can provide insights into patterns and mechanisms of change in socially transmitted traits. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of songs of the House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus) across an interval of 37 years (in 1975 and in 2012). Recordings from both years were collected in western Long Island, New York, which is thought to be the initial site of introduction of the House Finch around 1940 from the West Coast. Song types experienced a complete turnover during this period, although half of the syllable types were represented in both samples. Song length, frequency bandwidth and several other spectrographic features were the same in both years, and no structural features predicted recurrence of individual syllables. Consistent with the fact that our study population expanded substantially following a cultural founder effect, song and syllable sharing and similarity between individuals were lower in 2012 than in 1975, reflecting an increase in song diversity at the population level. However, in the more recent sample individual songs had fewer syllables, and were sung with less sequence stereotypy across renditions than in the earlier sample. Syllable prevalence in 2012 was associated both with complexity (as gauged by frequency excursion) and increased minimum frequency. Thus, over nearly 4 decades, Eastern House Finch songs remained structurally similar at the whole-song level, diversified between individuals, but became simpler and less consistent within an individual.},

For example, no sex differences were detected in the size of the splenium of the corpus callosum, but female rats had more axons in this area than did male rats. These ``cognitive'' regions of the brain are susceptible to the nature of the postweaning environment; the degree and even direction of sex differences was influenced by the environment. There is evidence that testosterone plays a role in the dimorphism of the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {The effect of learned culture (e.g., birdsong dialects and human languages) on genetic divergence is unclear. Previous theoretical research suggests that because oblique learning allows phenotype transmission from individuals with no offspring to an unrelated individual in the next generation, the effect of sexual selection on the learned trait is masked. However, I propose that migration and spatially constrained learning can form statistical associations between cultural and genetic traits, which may allow selection on the cultural traits to indirectly affect the genetic traits. Here, I build a population genetic model that allows such statistical associations to form and find that sexual selection and divergent selection on the cultural trait can indeed help maintain genetic divergence through such statistical associations, while selection against genetic hybrids does not affect cultural trait divergence. Furthermore, I find that even when the cultural trait changes over time due to drift and mutation, it can still help maintain genetic divergence. These results suggest the role of obliquely transmitted traits in evolution may be underrated, and the lack of one-to-one associations between cultural and genetic traits may not be sufficient to disprove the role of culture in genetic divergence.},

The differences in song structure may reflect differences in natural selection pressures between wild and domestic environments.

Thus, we compared song variations in relation to ecological factors and dispersal history of white-rumped munias to understand song evolutionary processes. We found geographic variations of song syntactical complexity. The difference of song syntactical complexity did not corresponded to genetic distance, but did to that of the proportion of mixed flocks with sympatric related species. Birds that inhabited the areas with more mixed flocks sang simpler songs. The song complexity might be constrained to intensify distinct conspecific signals from related species. Our field work provided empirical evidence supporting a proposal made by Deacon (2010).

Significant themes covered include the evidence for Marian apparitions, traditional religious pilgrimage, and the changes the Internet has brought to pilgrimage and Marian devotion. Stafford Poole, CM's The Guadalupan Controversies in Mexico (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2006), Robert Maniura's Pilgrimage to Images in the Fifteenth Century: The Origins of the Cult of Our Lady of Czestochowa (Woodbridge: Boyell Press, 2004), and Paolo Apolito's The Internet and the Madonna: Religious Visionary Experience on the Web (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005) all treat specific sites of Marian pilgrimage and are reviewed at length. In contrast, Swanson's edited volume, The Church and Mary: Papers Read at the 2001 Summer Meeting and the 2002 Winter Meeting of the Ecclesiastical History Society (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2004), contains a large number of papers on a range of issues relating to the cult of Mary including music, relics, visions, and the spread of Marian veneration.

  abstract = {Variation in avian diversity in space and time is commonly used as a metric to assess environmental changes. Conventionally, such data were collected by expert observers, but passively collected acoustic data is rapidly emerging as an alternative survey technique. However, efficiently extracting accurate species richness data from large audio datasets has proven challenging. Recent advances in deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) have transformed the field of machine learning, frequently outperforming traditional signal processing techniques in the domain of acoustic event detection and classification. We developed a DNN, called BirdNET, capable of identifying 984 North American and European bird species by sound. Our task-specific model architecture was derived from the family of residual networks (ResNets), consisted of 157 layers with more than 27 million parameters, and was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup. We tested the model against three independent datasets: (a) 22,960 single-species recordings; (b) 286~h of fully annotated soundscape data collected by an array of autonomous recording units in a design analogous to what researchers might use to measure avian diversity in a field setting; and (c) 33,670~h of soundscape data from a single high-quality omnidirectional microphone deployed near four eBird hotspots frequented by expert birders. We found that domain-specific data augmentation is key to build models that are robust against high ambient noise levels and can cope with overlapping vocalizations. Task-specific model designs and training regimes for audio event recognition perform on-par with very complex architectures used in other domains (e.g., object detection in images). We also found that high temporal resolution of input spectrograms (short FFT window length) improves the classification performance for bird sounds. In summary, BirdNET achieved a mean average precision of 0.791 for single-species recordings, a F0.5 score of 0.414 for annotated soundscapes, and an average correlation of 0.251 with hotspot observation across 121 species and 4~years of audio data. By enabling the efficient extraction of the vocalizations of many hundreds of bird species from potentially vast amounts of audio data, BirdNET and similar tools have the potential to add tremendous value to existing and future passively collected audio datasets and may transform the field of avian ecology and conservation.},

In this range of limited sustained activity (LSA), the activity of neural populations in the network persists between the extremes of either quickly dying out or activating the whole network. Hierarchical modular networks were previously found to show a wider parameter range for LSA than random or small-world networks not possessing hierarchical organization or multiple modules. Here we explored how variation in the number of hierarchical levels and modules per level influenced network dynamics and occurrence of LSA. We tested hierarchical configurations of different network sizes, approximating the large-scale networks linking cortical columns in one hemisphere of the rat, cat, or macaque monkey brain. Scaling of the network size affected the number of hierarchical levels and modules in the optimal networks, also depending on whether global edge density or the numbers of connections per node were kept constant. For constant edge density, only few network configurations, possessing an intermediate number of levels and a large number of modules, led to a large range of LSA independent of brain size. For a constant number of node connections, there was a trend for optimal configurations in larger-size networks to possess a larger number of hierarchical levels or more modules. These results may help to explain the trend to greater network complexity apparent in larger brains and may indicate that this complexity is required for maintaining stable levels of neural activation.},

  abstract = {The calling behaviour of Paridae species (i.e. titmice, tits and chickadees) in a predator-related context is well-studied. Parid species are known to alter call types, note composition or call duration according to predation risk. However, how these species encode information about a non-threatening context, such as food sources, has been subject to only few studies. Studies in Carolina chickadees (\emph{Poecile carolinensis}) have shown that this species alters the ratio of C and D notes to encode information about the presence of food and/or the flight behaviour of the signaller. This suggests that parids also use graded signals to encode information about non-predatory contexts. No study to date has directly compared the calls of a feeding context with those of a predation (i.e. mobbing) context. Hence, the aim of this study was to compare the calling behaviour of these two situations in great tits (\emph{Parus major}). Calls uttered at a feeder were recorded, analysed and compared with calls uttered in front of taxidermy mounts of sparrowhawks (\emph{Accipiter nisus}). In the food context, great tits reduced the number of D notes and increased the number of B, C and E notes compared with the mobbing context. Furthermore, tits produced calls with longer D notes and shorter intervals between D notes than in the mobbing context. This indicates that great tits use two mechanisms of graded signals (i.e. note type and acoustic structure of D calls) to inform conspecifics about the nature of a situation.}

Some of the most complex knowledge that people acquire, such as languages or cultural norms, can only be learned from other people, who themselves learned from previous generations. The prevalence of this process of "iterated learning" as a mode of cultural transmission raises the question of how it affects the information being transmitted. Analyses of iterated learning utilizing the assumption that the learners are Bayesian agents predict that this process should converge to an equilibrium that reflects the inductive biases of the learners. An experiment in iterated function learning with human participants confirmed this prediction, providing insight into the consequences of intergenerational knowledge transmission and a method for discovering the inductive biases that guide human inferences.},

  abstract = {Introductory gestures are present at the beginning of many animal displays. For example, lizards start their head-bobbing displays with introductory push-ups and animal vocal displays begin with introductory notes. Songbirds also begin their vocal displays by repeating introductory notes (INs) before producing their learned song and these INs are thought to reflect motor preparation. Between individuals of a given species, the acoustic structure of INs and the number of times INs are repeated before song varies considerably. While similar variation in songs between individuals is known to be a result of learning, whether INs are also learned remains poorly understood. Here, using natural and experimental tutoring with male zebra finches, we show that mean IN number and IN acoustic structure are learned from a tutor, independent of song learning. We also reveal biological predispositions in IN production; birds artificially tutored with songs lacking INs still repeated a short-duration syllable, thrice on average, before their songs. Overall, these results show that INs, just like elements in song, are shaped both by learning and biological predispositions and suggest multiple, independent, learning processes underlying the acquisition of complex vocal displays.}

We found a significant latitudinal gradient in several basic elements of song performance and complexity between north temperate and tropical populations. Furthermore,we document convergence in song patterns between populations at higher latitudes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Effects were strongest for the number of elements in a song, and the rate of element production, both increasing towards the poles, with similar but weaker effects for other song dimensions (e.g. number of unique elements, trills and trill rate). We consider possible causes related to variable habitats and morphology, concluding that the shorter breeding seasons at higher latitudes in both hemispheres may favour greater song elaboration to mediate territory competition and mate choice.},

Understanding how group-level patterns of culture emerge from individual-level behaviour is a long-standing question in the biological and social sciences. We develop a simulation model capturing demographic and cultural dynamics relevant to human cultural evolution, focusing on the interface between population-level patterns and individual-level processes. The model tracks the distribution of variants of cultural traits across individuals in a population over time, conditioned on different pathways for the transmission of information between individuals. From these data, we obtain theoretical expectations for a range of statistics commonly used to capture population-level characteristics (e.g. the degree of cultural diversity). Consistent with previous theoretical work, our results show that the patterns observed at the level of groups are rooted in the interplay between the transmission pathways and the age structure of the population. We also explore whether, and under what conditions, the different pathways can be distinguished based on their group-level signatures, in an effort to establish theoretical limits to inference. Our results show that the temporal dynamic of cultural change over time retains a stronger signature than the cultural composition of the population at a specific point in time. Overall, the results suggest a shift in focus from identifying the one individual-level process that likely produced the observed data to excluding those that likely did not. We conclude by discussing the implications for empirical studies of human cultural evolution.},

To date, much of the theoretical work on social learning has been done in isolation of data, and consequently many insights focus on revealing the learning processes or the distributions of cultural variants that are expected to have evolved in human populations. In population genetics, recent methodological advances have allowed a greater understanding of the explicit demographic and/or selection mechanisms that underlie observed allele frequency distributions across the globe, and their change through time. In particular, generative frameworks\textemdash often using coalescent-based simulation coupled with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)\textemdash have provided robust inferences on the human past, with no reliance on a priori assumptions of equilibrium. Here, we demonstrate the applicability and utility of generative inference approaches to the field of cultural evolution. The framework advocated here uses observed population-level frequency data directly to establish the likely presence or absence of particular hypothesized learning strategies. In this context, we discuss the problem of equifinality and argue that, in the light of sparse cultural data and the multiplicity of possible social learning processes, the exclusion of those processes inconsistent with the observed data might be the most instructive outcome. Finally, we summarize the findings of generative inference approaches applied to a number of case studies.This article is part of the theme issue `Bridging cultural gaps: interdisciplinary studies in human cultural evolution'.}

  abstract = {Empirical work has shown that human cultural transmission can be heavily influenced by population age structure. We aim to explore the role of such age structure in shaping the cultural composition of a population when cultural transmission occurs in an unbiased way. In particular, we are interested in understanding the effect induced by the interplay between age structure and the cultural transmission process by allowing cultural transmission from individuals within a limited age range only. To this end we develop an age-structured cultural transmission model and find that age-structured and non age-structured populations evolving through unbiased transmission possess very similar cultural compositions (at a single point in time) at the population and sample level if the copy pool consists of a sufficiently large fraction of the population. If, however, an age constraint\textemdash a structural constraint restricting the pool of potential role models to individuals of a limited age range\textemdash{} exists, the cultural compositions of age-structured and non age-structured population show stark differences. This may have drastic consequences for our ability to correctly analyse cultural data sets. Rejections of tests of neutrality, blind to age structure and, importantly, the interaction between age structure and cultural transmission, are only indicative of biased transmission if it is known a priori that there are no or only weak age constraints acting on the pool of role models. As this knowledge is rarely available for specific empirical case studies we develop a generative inference approach based on our age-structured cultural transmission model and machine learning techniques. We show that in some circumstances it is possible to simultaneously infer the characteristics of the age structure, the nature of the transmission process, and the interplay between them from observed samples of cultural variants. Our results also point to hard limits on inference from population-level data at a single point in time, regardless of the approach used.},

  abstract = {Surprisingly little is known about the eye movements of chimpanzees, despite the potential contribution of such knowledge to comparative cognition studies. Here, we present the first examination of eye tracking in chimpanzees. We recorded the eye movements of chimpanzees as they viewed naturalistic pictures containing a full-body image of a chimpanzee, a human or another mammal; results were compared with those from humans. We found a striking similarity in viewing patterns between the two species. Both chimpanzees and humans looked at the animal figures for longer than at the background and at the face region for longer than at other parts of the body. The face region was detected at first sight by both species when they were shown pictures of chimpanzees and of humans. However, the eye movements of chimpanzees also exhibited distinct differences from those of humans; the former shifted the fixation location more quickly and more broadly than the latter. In addition, the average duration of fixation on the face region was shorter in chimpanzees than in humans. Overall, our results clearly demonstrate the eye-movement strategies common to the two primate species and also suggest several notable differences manifested during the observation of pictures of scenes and body forms.},

This study is the first to use the eye-tracking method to perform direct comparisons between humans and chimpanzees with regard to face scanning. Members of both species viewed the same sets of photographs representing conspecific and nonconspecific faces under the same experimental conditions. Chimpanzees and humans showed systematic and similar patterns of face scanning, including intensely viewing main facial features (i.e. eyes, nose and mouth) and inspecting the eyes and mouth, in that order. However, several differences between the species were also evident. For example, humans were more likely to show sequential refixations on the eye regions than were chimpanzees, whereas chimpanzees were more likely to engage in quick, vertical scanning over the eyes and mouth. Such species similarities and differences were consistent across conspecific and nonconspecific faces and were thus independent of the external morphologies of species-specific faces. Furthermore, when presented with facial expressions, chimpanzees changed their scanning patterns in response to those facial actions, whereas humans maintained intense eye viewing across the expressions. Finally, we discuss how these face-scanning patterns are related to species-specific forms of facial communication in chimpanzees and humans, and suggest that both species have unique eye movement strategies for interactions with conspecifics. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

  abstract = {This study offers a new method for examining the bodily, manual, and eye movements of a chimpanzee at the micro-level. A female chimpanzee wore a lightweight head-mounted eye tracker (60 Hz) on her head while engaging in daily interactions with the human experimenter. The eye tracker recorded her eye movements accurately while the chimpanzee freely moved her head, hands, and body. Three video cameras recorded the bodily and manual movements of the chimpanzee from multiple angles. We examined how the chimpanzee viewed the experimenter in this interactive setting and how the eye movements were related to the ongoing interactive contexts and actions. We prepared two experimentally defined contexts in each session: a face-to-face greeting phase upon the appearance of the experimenter in the experimental room, and a subsequent face-to-face task phase that included manual gestures and fruit rewards. Overall, the general viewing pattern of the chimpanzee, measured in terms of duration of individual fixations, length of individual saccades, and total viewing duration of the experimenter's face/body, was very similar to that observed in previous eye-tracking studies that used non-interactive situations, despite the differences in the experimental settings. However, the chimpanzee viewed the experimenter and the scene objects differently depending on the ongoing context and actions. The chimpanzee viewed the experimenter's face and body during the greeting phase, but viewed the experimenter's face and hands as well as the fruit reward during the task phase. These differences can be explained by the differential bodily/manual actions produced by the chimpanzee and the experimenter during each experimental phase (i.e., greeting gestures, task cueing). Additionally, the chimpanzee's viewing pattern varied depending on the identity of the experimenter (i.e., the chimpanzee's prior experience with the experimenter). These methods and results offer new possibilities for examining the natural gaze behavior of chimpanzees.},

He claimed that this ``Law of Abbreviation'' is a universal structural property of language. The Law of Abbreviation has since been documented in a wide range of human languages, and extended to animal communication systems and even computer programming languages. Zipf hypothesised that this universal design feature arises as a result of individuals optimising form-meaning mappings under competing pressures to communicate accurately but also efficiently\textemdash his famous Principle of Least Effort. In this study, we use a miniature artificial language learning paradigm to provide direct experimental evidence for this explanatory hypothesis. We show that language users optimise form-meaning mappings only when pressures for accuracy and efficiency both operate during a communicative task, supporting Zipf's conjecture that the Principle of Least Effort can explain this universal feature of word length distributions.},

(Detecting evolutionary forces in language change, Nature 551, 2017) tackle an important but difficult problem in linguistics, the testing of selective theories of language change against a null model of drift. Having applied a test from population genetics (the Frequency Increment Test) to a number of relevant examples, they suggest stochasticity has a previously under-appreciated role in language evolution. We replicate their results and find that while the overall observation holds, results produced by this approach on individual time series can be sensitive to how the corpus is organized into temporal segments (binning). Furthermore, we use a large set of simulations in conjunction with binning to systematically explore the range of applicability of the Frequency Increment Test. We conclude that care should be exercised with interpreting results of tests like the Frequency Increment Test on individual series, given the researcher degrees of freedom available when applying the test to corpus data, and fundamental differences between genetic and linguistic data. Our findings have implications for selection testing and temporal binning in general, as well as demonstrating the usefulness of simulations for evaluating methods newly introduced to the field.}

This is due to boundary effects that occur in nonparametric curve estimation problems. A number of proposals have been made in the kernel density estimation context with some success. As of yet there appears to be no single dominating solution that corrects the boundary problem for all shapes of densities. In this paper, we propose a new general method of boundary correction for univariate kernel density estimation. The proposed method generates a class of boundary corrected estimators. They all possess desirable properties such as local adaptivity and non-negativity. In simulation, it is observed that the proposed method perform quite well when compared with other existing methods available in the literature for most shapes of densities, showing a very important robustness property of the method. The theory behind the new approach and the bias and variance of the proposed estimators are given. Results of a data analysis are also given. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

To relate the findings from studying birdsongs to other sequential behaviors such as human speech and musical performance, it is crucial to characterize the statistical properties of the sequencing rules in birdsongs. However, the properties of the sequencing rules in birdsongs have not yet been fully addressed. In this study, we investigate the statistical properties of the complex birdsong of the Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata var. domestica). Based on manual-annotated syllable labeles, we first show that there are significant higher-order context dependencies in Bengalese finch songs, that is, which syllable appears next depends on more than one previous syllable. We then analyze acoustic features of the song and show that higher-order context dependencies can be explained using first-order hidden state transition dynamics with redundant hidden states. This model corresponds to hidden Markov models (HMMs), well known statistical models with a large range of application for time series modeling. The song annotation with these models with first-order hidden state dynamics agreed well with manual annotation, the score was comparable to that of a second-order HMM, and surpassed the zeroth-order model (the Gaussian mixture model; GMM), which does not use context information. Our results imply that the hierarchical representation with hidden state dynamics may underlie the neural implementation for generating complex behavioral sequences with higher-order dependencies. \textcopyright{} 2011 Katahira et al.},

In humans, genetic distances are correlated with distances based on cranial form, suggesting that population structure influences both genetic and quantitative trait variation. Studies controlling for this structure have demonstrated significant underlying associations of cranial distances with ecological distances derived from climate variables. However, to assess the biological importance of an ecological predictor, estimates of effect size and uncertainty in the original units of measurement are clearly preferable to significance claims based on units of distance. Unfortunately, the magnitudes of ecological effects are difficult to obtain with distance-based methods, while models that produce estimates of effect size generally do not scale to high-dimensional data like cranial shape and form.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMethods\textbackslash nUsing recent innovations that extend quantitative genetics mixed models to highly multivariate observations, we estimate morphological effects associated with a climate predictor for a subset of the Howells craniometric dataset.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nResults\textbackslash nSeveral measurements, particularly those associated with cranial vault breadth, show a substantial linear association with climate, and the multivariate model incorporating a climate predictor is preferred in model comparison.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nConclusions\textbackslash nPrevious studies demonstrated the existence of a relationship between climate and cranial form.

We detect modest directional differences between foragers and farmers. The effects are consistent with softer diets in preindustrial farming groups and are most pronounced and reliably directional when the farming class is limited to dairying populations. Diet effect magnitudes are relatively small, affirming the primary role of neutral evolutionary processes-genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow structured by population history and migrations-in shaping diversity in the human skull. The results also bring an additional perspective to the paradox of why Homo sapiens, particularly agriculturalists, appear to be relatively well suited to efficient (high-leverage) chewing.},

  abstract = {For many taxa, vocal communication is an essential means of navigating continuously changing social and ecological environments. Among passerine birds, vocal signals are critical to survival and play an important role in mate attraction, territory defense, and predator avoidance. In my dissertation, I study acoustic communication in a wild population of blue tits and great tits in order to investigate the effects of social environment on birds' responses to acoustic cues as well as their production of acoustic signals. In Chapter 1, I demonstrate that blue tits can learn to associate a novel acoustic cue with predation risk, and that the behavioral response to this cue can be socially transmitted to na\"ive great tits, despite their lack of first-hand experience. This study suggests that social learning of acoustic cues can occur between species. In the second chapter, I develop an unsupervised machine learning approach that can objectively measure similarity of vocal signals. I present this technique such that it can be broadly applied for the analysis of diverse acoustic datasets. Using this approach, I then explore patterns of variation in great tit songs from multiple angles. In Chapter 3, I develop and test a mathematical model that describes the optimal levels of vocal similarity among neighbors under given social and ecological conditions. This model predicts that immigrant and resident birds will exhibit comparable levels of vocal similarity with neighbors, despite having different song learning opportunities in their natal environments. My empirical results agree with model predictions, showing that although immigrants more often use complex, unshared songs, they achieve high levels of vocal similarity with neighbors by using larger repertoires than residents. I further explore spatial and temporal variation of great tit songs in Chapter 4, and show that an individual's songs reflect both their immigration status and their breeding territory location. I also find that songs change between subsequent years, and that this is largely due to the appearance and disappearance of individual birds. Together, my findings suggest that individuals continuously adapt their vocal behavior to changing social environments, and that interactions with both conspecifics and heterospecifics may shape vocal communication systems.},

  abstract = {Cumulative culture is thought to have played a major role in hominin evolution, and so an understanding of the factors that affect cultural accumulation is important for understanding human evolution. Population size may be one such factor, with larger populations thought to be able to support more complex cultural traits. This hypothesis has been suggested by mathematical models and empirical studies of small-scale societies. However, to date there have been few experimental demonstrations of an effect of population size on cultural accumulation. Here we provide such a demonstration using a novel task, solving jigsaw puzzles. 80 participants divided into ten transmission chains solved puzzles in one of two conditions: one in which participants had access to one semi-completed puzzle from the previous generation, and the other in which participants simultaneously saw three semi-completed puzzles from the previous generation. As predicted, the mean number of pieces solved increased over time in the three-puzzle-per-generation condition, but not in the one-puzzle-per-generation condition. Thus, our experiment provides support for a hypothesized relationship between population size and cultural accumulation. In particular, our results suggest that the ability to simultaneously learn from multiple cultural models, and combine the knowledge of those multiple models, is most likely to allow larger groups to support more complex culture. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

We present a gene-culture coevolutionary analysis of a small selection of such rules (unbiased social learning, payoff-biased social learning and frequency-dependent biased social learning, including conformism and anti-conformism) in a population of asocial learners where the environment is subject to a constant probability of change to a novel state. We define conditions under which each rule evolves to a genetically polymorphic equilibrium. We find that payoff-biased social learning may evolve under high levels of environmental variation if the fitness benefit associated with the acquired behaviour is either high or low but not of intermediate value. In contrast, both conformist and anti-conformist biases can become fixed when environment variation is low, whereupon the mean fitness in the population is higher than for a population of asocial learners. Our examination of the population dynamics reveals stable limit cycles under conformist and anti-conformist biases and some highly complex dynamics including chaos. Anti-conformists can out-compete conformists when conditions favour a low equilibrium frequency of the learned behaviour. We conclude that evolution, punctuated by the repeated successful invasion of different social learning rules, should continuously favour a reduction in the equilibrium frequency of asocial learning, and propose that, among competing social learning rules, the dominant rule will be the one that can persist with the lowest frequency of asocial learning.},

We exposed four captive groups of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) to a novel extractive foraging device and, by fitting statistical models, isolated four simultaneously operating transmission biases. These include biases to copy (i) higher-ranking and (ii) expert individuals, and to copy others when (iii) uncertain or (iv) of low rank. High-ranking individuals were relatively un-strategic in their use of acquired knowledge, which, combined with the bias for others to observe them, may explain reports that high innovation rates (in juveniles and subordinates) do not generate a correspondingly high frequency of traditions in chimpanzees. Given the typically low rank of immigrants in chimpanzees, a 'copying dominants' bias may contribute to the observed maintenance of distinct cultural repertoires in neighboring communities despite sharing similar ecology and knowledgeable migrants. Thus, a copying dominants strategy may, as often proposed for conformist transmission, and perhaps in concert with it, restrict the accumulation of traditions within chimpanzee communities whilst maintaining cultural diversity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Stressful life events are associated with the onset of episodes of major depression. However, exposure to stressful life events is influenced by genetic factors, and these factors are correlated with those that predispose to major depression. The aim of this study was to clarify the degree to which stressful life events cause major depression. METHOD: The authors assessed the occurrence of 15 classes of stressful life events and the onset of DSM-III-R major depression over a 1-year period in female twins ascertained from a population-based registry. The sample contained 24,648 person-months and 316 onsets of major depression. Stressful life events were individually rated on contextual threat and dependence (the degree to which the stressful life event could have resulted from the respondent's behavior). The nature of the relationship between stressful life events and major depression was tested by 1) discrete-time survival analysis examining the relationship between dependence and the depressogenic effect of stressful life events and 2) a co-twin control analysis. RESULTS: While independent stressful life events were significantly associated with onsets of depression, when level of threat was controlled, the association was significantly stronger for dependent events. The odds ratio for onset of major depression in the month of a stressful life event was 5.64 in all subjects, 4.52 within dizygotic pairs, and 3.58 within monozygotic pairs. CONCLUSIONS: Stressful life events have a substantial causal relationship with the onset of episodes of major depression. However, about one-third of the association between stressful life events and onsets of depression is noncausal, since individuals predisposed to major depression select themselves into high-risk environments.},

METHODS: High contextual threat stressful life events, assessed in 98 592 person-months from 7322 male and female adult twins ascertained from a population-based registry, were blindly rated on the dimensions of humiliation, entrapment, loss, and danger and their categories. Onsets of pure major depression (MD), pure generalized anxiety syndrome (GAS) (defined as generalized anxiety disorder with a 2-week minimum duration), and mixed MD-GAS episodes were examined using logistic regression. RESULTS: Onsets of pure MD and mixed MD-GAS were predicted by higher ratings of loss and humiliation. Onsets of pure GAS were predicted by higher ratings of loss and danger. High ratings of entrapment predicted only onsets of mixed episodes. The loss categories of death and respondent-initiated separation predicted pure MD but not pure GAS episodes. Events with a combination of humiliation (especially other-initiated separation) and loss were more depressogenic than pure loss events, including death. No sex differences were seen in the prediction of episodes of illness by event categories. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to loss, humiliating events that directly devalue an individual in a core role were strongly linked to risk for depressive episodes. Event dimensions and categories that predispose to pure MD vs pure GAS episodes can be distinguished with moderate specificity. The event dimensions that preceded mixed MD-GAS episodes were largely the sum of those that preceded pure MD and pure GAS episodes.},

To address this question empirically, the author examines how well DSM-5 symptomatic criteria for major depression capture the descriptions of clinical de-pression in the post-Kraepelin Western psychiatric tradition as described in textbooks published between 1900 and 1960. Eighteen symptoms and signs of depression were described, 10 of which are covered by the DSM criteria for major depression or melancholia. For two symptoms (mood and cognitive content), DSM criteria are considerably narrower than those described in the textbooks. Five symptoms and signs (changes in volition/motivation, slowing of speech, anxiety, other physical symptoms, and depersonalization/ derealization) are not present in the DSM criteria. Compared with the DSM criteria, these authors gave greater emphasis to cognitive, physical, and psychomotor changes, and less to neurovegetative symptoms. These results suggest that im-portant features of major depression are not captured by DSM criteria. This is unproblematic as long as DSM criteria are un-derstood to index rather than constitute psychiatric disorders. However, since DSM-III, our field has moved toward a re-ification of DSM that implicitly assumes that psychiatric dis-orders are actually just the DSM criteria. That is, we have taken an index of something for the thing itself. For example, good diagnostic criteria should be succinct and require minimal inference, but some critical clinical phenomena are subtle, difficult to assess, and experienced in widely varying ways. This conceptual error has contributed to the impoverish-ment of psychopathology and has affected our research, clinical work, and teaching in some undesirable ways.},

Here we investigate whether the strength of the signaller\textendash receiver social bond affects response to calls that attract others to help mob a predator. Using field-based playback experiments on a habituated population of wild dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula), we first demonstrate that a particular vocalization given on detecting predatory snakes does act as a recruitment call; receivers were more likely to look, approach and engage in mobbing behaviour than in response to control close calls. We then show that individuals respond more strongly to these recruitment calls if they are from groupmates with whom they are more strongly bonded (those with whom they preferentially groom and forage). Our study, therefore, provides novel evidence about the anti-predator benefits of close bonds within social groups.},

However, no one definition of 'complexity' appears to be appropriate for all uses. Repertoire size has been used to quantify complexity in many bird and some mammalian studies, but is impractical in cases where vocalizations are highly diverse, and repertoire size is essentially non-limited at realistic sample sizes. Some researchers have used information-theoretic measures such as Shannon entropy, to describe vocal complexity, but these techniques are descriptive only, as they do not address hypotheses of the cognitive mechanisms behind vocal signal generation. In addition, it can be shown that simple measures of entropy, in particular, do not capture syntactic structure. In this work, I demonstrate the use of an alternative information-theoretic measure, the Markov entropy rate, which quantifies the diversity of transitions in a vocal sequence, and thus is capable of distinguishing sequences with syntactic structure from those generated by random, statistically independent processes. I use artificial sequences generated from different stochastic mechanisms, as well as real data from the vocalizations of the rock hyrax Procavia capensis, to show how different complexity metrics scale differently with sample size. I show that entropy rate provides a good measure of complexity for Markov processes and converges faster than repertoire size estimates, such as the Lempel-Ziv metric. The commonly used Shannon entropy performs poorly in quantifying complexity. \textcopyright{} 2013 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {Animal acoustic communication often takes the form of complex sequences, made up of multiple distinct acoustic units. Apart from the well-known example of birdsong, other animals such as insects, amphibians, and mammals (including bats, rodents, primates, and cetaceans) also generate complex acoustic sequences. Occasionally, such as with birdsong, the adaptive role of these sequences seems clear (e.g. mate attraction and territorial defence). More often however, researchers have only begun to characterise \textendash{} let alone understand \textendash{} the significance and meaning of acoustic sequences. Hypotheses abound, but there is little agreement as to how sequences should be defined and analysed. Our review aims to outline suitablemethods for testing these hypotheses, and to describe the major limitations to our current and near-future knowledge on questions of acoustic sequences. This review and prospectus is the result of a collaborative effort between 43 scientists from the fields of animal behaviour, ecology and evolution, signal processing, machine learning, quantitative linguistics, and information theory, who gathered for a 2013 workshop entitled, `Analysing vocal sequences in animals'. Our goal is to present not just a review of the state of the art, but to propose a methodological framework that summarises what we suggest are the best practices for research in this field, across taxa and across disciplines.We also provide a tutorial-style introduction to some of the most promising algorithmic approaches for analysing sequences. We divide our review into three sections: identifying the distinct units of an acoustic sequence, describing the different ways that information can be contained within a sequence, and analysing the structure of that sequence. Each of these sections is further subdivided to address the key questions and approaches in that area.We propose a uniform, systematic, and comprehensive approach to studying sequences, with the goal of clarifying research terms used in different fields, and facilitating collaboration and comparative studies. Allowing greater interdisciplinary collaboration will facilitate the investigation of many important questions in the evolution of communication and sociality.},

  abstract = {Communicative complexity is a key behavioural and ecological indicator in the study of animal cognition. Much attention has been given to measures such as repertoire size and syntactic structure in both bird and mammal vocalizations, as large repertoires and complex call combinations may give an indication of the cognitive abilities both of the sender and receiver. However, many animals communicate using a continuous vocal signal that does not easily lend itself to be described by concepts such as `repertoire'. For example, dolphin whistles and wolf howls both have complex patterns of frequency modulation, so that no two howls or whistles are quite the same. Is there a sense in which some of these vocalizations may be more `complex' than others? Can we arrive at a quantitative metric for complexity in a continuously varying signal? Such a metric would allow us to extend familiar analyses of communicative complexity to those species where vocal behaviour is not restricted to sequences of stereotyped syllables. We present four measures of complexity in continuous signals (Wiener Entropy, Autocorrelation, Inflection Point Count, and Parsons Entropy), and examine their relevance using example data from members of the genus Canis. We show that each metric can lead to different conclusions regarding which howls could be considered complex or not. Ultimately, complexity is poorly defined and researchers must compare metrics to ensure that they reflect the properties for which the hypothesis is being tested. \textcopyright{} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group},

Methods: The STG was measured in 30 female subjects (mean age = 14.73 {$\pm$} 6.41; range = 7.56-33.30) with TS and 30 age-matched control subjects (mean age = 14.63 {$\pm$} 5.90; range = 6.35-32.65) using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analyses. Results: Right STG, including both gray and white matter volumes, was significantly larger in TS compared with control subjects. Overall left STG volume was not significantly different between groups, although left white matter volume was increased in the TS subjects. The TS subgroup with a maternally derived X chromosome (Xm) demonstrated more aberrant STG volumes compared with subjects with a paternally (Xp) derived X and control subjects. The difference in STG volumes between Xm and control subjects involved both white and gray matter. The Xm subjects differed from Xp subjects only in terms of gray matter.

NWCRC collaborated with study sponsors to unblind the randomization codes from 16 trials for 293 patients assigned to antidepressants and 169 patients assigned to placebo. RESULTS: The mean total baseline HAM-D17 scores were relatively high and stable (mean of 24.7, range 22.2-27.4). The outcome, as measured by changes in mean total HAM-D17 scores between antidepressant and placebo, were similar and were not related to the year of the conduct of the trial. Furthermore, the baseline severity of depressive symptoms, and BMI played a significant role in the outcome with antidepressants and not with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that no diminution of drug-placebo difference occurs over time when baseline severity remains constant. As such, they support the importance of depression severity as a determinant of antidepressant-placebo difference.},

  abstract = {Inferences drawn from long-term field studies are vulnerable to biases in observability of different classes of individuals, which may lead to biases in the estimates of selection, or fitness. Population surveys that monitor breeding individuals can introduce such biases by not identifying individuals that fail early in their reproductive attempts. Here, we quantify how the standard protocol for detecting breeding females introduces bias in a long-term population study of the great tit, Parus major. We do so by identifying females whose breeding attempts fail before they would normally be censused and explore whether this early failure can be predicted by a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We investigate the effect of these biases on estimates of reproductive performance and selection. We show that females that go undetected by standard censusing because they fail early in their breeding attempt were less likely to have been previously trapped within our study site and were more likely to breed in poor-quality habitats. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this bias sampling had lead previous studies on this population to overestimate the reproductive performance of unringed females, which are likely to be immigrants to the population. Finally, we show that these biases in detectability influence estimates of selection on a key life-history trait. While these conclusions are specific to this study, we suggest that such effects are likely to be widespread and that more attention should be given to whether or not methods for surveying natural populations introduce systematic bias that will influence conclusions about ecological and evolutionary processes.},

  abstract = {The song of oscines provides an extensively studied model of age-dependent behaviour changes. Male and female receivers might use song characteristics to obtain information about the age of a signaller, which is often related to its quality. Whereas most of the age-dependent song changes have been studied in solo singing, the role of age in vocal interactions is less well understood. We addressed this issue in a playback study with common nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos). Previous studies showed that male nightingales had smaller repertoires in their first year than older males and males adjusted their repertoire towards the most common songs in the breeding population. We now compared vocal interaction patterns in a playback study in 12 one year old and 12 older nightingales (cross-sectional approach). Five of these males were tested both in their first and second breeding season (longitudinal approach). Song duration and latency to respond did not differ between males of different ages in either approach. In the cross-sectional approach, one year old nightingales matched song types twice as often as did older birds. Similarly, in the longitudinal approach all except one bird reduced the number of song type matches in their second season. Individuals tended to overlap songs at higher rates in their second breeding season than in their first. The higher levels of song type matches in the first year and song overlapping by birds in their second year suggest that these are communicative strategies to establish relationships with competing males and/or choosy females. \textcopyright{} 2011 Kiefer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {A neural correlate of parametric working memory is a stimulus-specific rise in neuron firing rate that persists long after the stimulus is removed. Network models with local excitation and broad inhibition support persistent neural activity, linking network architecture and parametric working memory. Cortical neurons receive noisy input fluctuations that cause persistent activity to diffusively wander about the network, degrading memory over time. We explore how cortical architecture that supports parametric working memory affects the diffusion of persistent neural activity. Studying both a spiking network and a simplified potential well model, we show that spatially heterogeneous excitatory coupling stabilizes a discrete number of persistent states, reducing the diffusion of persistent activity over the network. However, heterogeneous coupling also coarse-grains the stimulus representation space, limiting the storage capacity of parametric working memory. The storage errors due to coarse-graining and diffusion trade off so that information transfer between the initial and recalled stimulus is optimized at a fixed network heterogeneity. For sufficiently long delay times, the optimal number of attractors is less than the number of possible stimuli, suggesting that memory networks can under-represent stimulus space to optimize performance. Our results clearly demonstrate the combined effects of network architecture and stochastic fluctuations on parametric memory storage.},

This suggests that premenstrual change is both a lived experience and social construction, which is not inevitably positioned as debilitating or distressing. However, previous research has provided little insight into how and why women construct premenstrual change as positive. Accordingly, the present study used a critical realist epistemology and a material-discursive-intrapsychic model to explore women's construction and lived experience of positive premenstrual change. Drawing on focus groups with 47 women, explanations for positive premenstrual experiences included: 'positive emotional outcomes', 'releasing tension', 'increased attractiveness', 'legitimacy of self-care' and 'indication of menstruation'. Findings not only reinforce reports from previous research that many women experience positive premenstrual changes, but also challenge bio-medical conceptualizations of premenstrual change as inherently negative, with accounts of relational negotiation emphasizing the context-dependent nature of premenstrual change. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.},

In doing so we provide the first experimental validation for the idea that cultural transmission can lead to the appearance of design without a designer. Our experiments involve the iterated learning of artificial languages by human participants. We show that languages transmitted culturally evolve in such a way as to maximize their own transmissibility: over time, the languages in our experiments become easier to learn and increasingly structured. Furthermore, this structure emerges purely as a consequence of the transmission of language over generations, without any intentional design on the part of individual language learners. Previous computational and mathematical models suggest that iterated learning provides an explanation for the structure of human language and link particular aspects of linguistic structure with particular constraints acting on language during its transmission. The experimental work presented here shows that the predictions of these models, and models of cultural evolution more generally, can be tested in the laboratory.},

These 3 complex adaptive systems exist in a network of interactions: individual learning biases shape the dynamics of cultural evolution; universal features of linguistic structure arise from this cultural process and form the ultimate linguistic phenotype; the nature of this phenotype affects the fitness landscape for the biological evolution of the language faculty; and in turn this determines individuals' learning bias. Using a combination of computational simulation, laboratory experiments, and comparison with real-world cases of language emergence, I show that linguistic structure emerges as a natural outcome of cultural evolution once certain minimal biological requirements are in place.},

A central question for evolutionary linguistics is the origin of the combinatorial structure of language (sometimes referred to as duality of patterning), one of language's basic design features. Emerging sign languages provide a promising arena to study the emergence of language properties. Many, but not all such sign languages exhibit combinatoriality, which generates testable hypotheses about its source. We hypothesize that combinatoriality is the inevitable result of learning biases in cultural transmission, and that population structure explains differences across languages. We construct an agent-based model with population turnover. Bayesian learning agents with a prior preference for compressible languages (modelling a pressure for language learnability) communicate in pairs under pressure to reduce ambiguity. We include two transmission conditions: agents learn the language either from the oldest agent or from an agent in the middle of their lifespan. Results suggest that (1) combinatoriality emerges during iterated cultural transmission under concurrent pressures for simplicity and expressivity and (2) population dynamics affect the rate of evolution, which is faster when agents learn from other learners than when they learn from old individuals. This may explain its absence in some emerging sign languages. We discuss the consequences of this finding for cultural evolution, highlighting the interplay of population-level, functional and cognitive factors.

Some antidepressants increase serotonin levels, some decrease it, and some have no effect at all on serotonin. Nevertheless, they all show the same therapeutic benefit. Even the small statistical difference between antidepressants and placebos may be an enhanced placebo effect, due to the fact that most patients and doctors in clinical trials successfully break blind. The serotonin theory is as close as any theory in the history of science to having been proved wrong. Instead of curing depression, popular antidepressants may induce a biological vulnerability making people more likely to become depressed in the future.},

  abstract = {A long-held view in evolutionary biology is that character displacement generates divergent phenotypes in closely related coexisting species to avoid the costs of hybridization or ecological competition, whereas an alternative possibility is that signals of dominance or aggression may instead converge to facilitate coexistence among ecological competitors. Although this counterintuitive process\textemdash termed convergent agonistic character displacement\textemdash is supported by recent theoretical and empirical studies, the extent to which it drives spatial patterns of trait evolution at continental scales remains unclear. By modelling the variation in song structure of two ecologically similar species of \emph{Hypocnemis} antbird across western Amazonia, we show that their territorial signals converge such that trait similarity peaks in the sympatric zone, where intense interspecific territoriality between these taxa has previously been demonstrated. We also use remote sensing data to show that signal convergence is not explained by environmental gradients and is thus unlikely to evolve by sensory drive (i.e. acoustic adaptation to the sound transmission properties of habitats). Our results suggest that agonistic character displacement driven by interspecific competition can generate spatial patterns opposite to those predicted by classic character displacement theory, and highlight the potential role of social selection in shaping geographical variation in signal phenotypes of ecological competitors.

  abstract = {Since the 1990s, suicide in recession-plagued Japan has soared, and rates of depression have both increased and received greater public attention. In a nation that has traditionally been uncomfortable addressing mental illness, what factors have allowed for the rising medicalization of depression and suicide? Investigating these profound changes from historical, clinical, and sociolegal perspectives, Depression in Japan explores how depression has become a national disease and entered the Japanese lexicon, how psychiatry has responded to the nation's ailing social order, and how, in a remarkable transformation, psychiatry has overcome the longstanding resistance to its intrusion in Japanese life. Questioning claims made by Japanese psychiatrists that depression hardly existed in premodern Japan, Junko Kitanaka shows that Japanese medicine did indeed have a language for talking about depression which was conceived of as an illness where psychological suffering was intimately connected to physiological and social distress. The author looks at how Japanese psychiatrists now use the discourse of depression to persuade patients that they are victims of biological and social forces beyond their control; analyzes how this language has been adopted in legal discourse surrounding "overwork suicide"; and considers how, in contrast to the West, this language curiously emphasizes the suffering of men rather than women. Examining patients' narratives, Kitanaka demonstrates how psychiatry constructs a gendering of depression, one that is closely tied to local politics and questions of legitimate social suffering.

  abstract = {The author reviews conceptual and empirical issues regarding the interaction of neurasthenia, somatization and depression in Chinese culture and in the West. The historical background of neurasthenia and its current status are discussed, along with the epidemiology and phenomenology of somatization and depression. Findings are presented from a combined clinical and anthropological field study of 100 patients with neurasthenia in the Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at the Hunan Medical College. Eighty-seven of these patients made the DSM-III criteria of Major Depressive Disorder; diagnoses of anxiety disorders were also frequent. Forty-four patients were suffering from chronic pain syndromes previously undiagnosed, and cases of culture-bound syndromes also were detected. For three-quarters of patients the social significances and uses of their illness behavior chiefly related to work. Although from the researchers' perspective 70\% of patients with Major Depressive Disorder experienced substantial improvement and 87\% some improvement in symptoms when treated with antidepressant medication, fewer experienced decreased help seeking, and a much smaller number perceived less social impairment and improvement in illnes problems (the psychosocial accompaniment of disease including maladaptive coping and work, family and school problems). These findings are drawn on to advance medical anthropology and cultural psychiatry theory and research regarding somatization in Chinese culture, the United States and cross culturally. The author concludes that though neurasthenia can be understood in several distinctive ways, it is most clinically useful to regard it as bioculturally patterned illness experience (a special form of somatization) related to either depression and other diseases or to culturally sanctioned idioms of distress and psychosocial coping.},

  abstract = {Purpose: According to modern bio-psychosocial theories of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), the aim of this study is to investigate systematically associations between selected psychosocial factors and premenstrual symptoms in different menstrual cycle phases. Method: Several psychosocial variables were assessed, in a sample of German women with PMS ( N = 90) and without premenstrual complaints ( N = 48) during the follicular and luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Presence of PMS was indicated by analysis of contemporary daily ratings of premenstrual symptom severity and impairment for one menstrual cycle. Results: Regarding perceived chronic stress ( \textnrleg{} = 0.34), self-efficacy ( \textnrleg{} = 0.12), and two dimensions of self-silencing (0.06 {$\leq$} \textnrleg{} {$\leq$} 0.11) analyses revealed only a significant effect of group. Regarding body dissatisfaction and somatosensory amplification, a significant effect of group (0.07 {$\leq$} \textnrleg{} {$\leq$} 0.16) and additionally a group by menstrual cycle phase interaction ( \textnrleg{} = 0.06) was identified. Regarding relationship quality, a significant effect of menstrual cycle phase ( \textnrleg{} = 0.08) and a group by menstrual cycle phase interaction ( \textnrleg{} = 0.06) was demonstrated. In respect to sexual contentment, acceptance of premenstrual symptoms, and the remaining two dimensions of self-silencing statistical analyses revealed no effects at all. Linear multiple regression analysis revealed that 20 \% of the variance in PMS symptom severity was explained by the psychosocial variables investigated. Body dissatisfaction ( \ss{} = 0.26, p = 0.018) and the divided self-dimension of self-silencing ( \ss{} = 0.35, p = 0.016) were significant correlates of PMS severity. Conclusion: Results of this study are consistent with previous research and additionally show patterns of associations between specific psychosocial factors and PMS in dependence of menstrual cycle phase that have not been researched before. The role of the psychosocial variables we investigated in regard to the development and maintenance of PMS should be clarified in future research.},

Recent models of this process predict that large, well-connected populations will have more diverse and complex tool kits than small, isolated populations. While several examples of the loss of technology in small populations are consistent with this prediction, it found no support in two systematic quantitative tests. Both studies were based on data from continental populations in which contact rates were not available, and therefore these studies do not provide a test of the models. Here, we show that in Oceania, around the time of early European contact, islands with small populations had less complicated marine foraging technology. This finding suggests that explanations of existing cultural variation based on optimality models alone are incomplete because demography plays an important role in generating cumulative cultural adaptation. It also indicates that hominin populations with similar cognitive abilities may leave very different archaeological records, a conclusion that has important implications for our understanding of the origin of anatomically modern humans and their evolved psychology.},

During the 1970s researchers in each nation utilised different research strategies to overcome variation and contradictory results characteristic of PMS research. Since the 1980s, attempts have been made to standardise research internationally through prospective daily rating questionnaires that diagnose and measure PMS. Amidst controversy, a psychiatric reformulation of the syndrome was included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). While the diagnostic criteria for this psychiatric category, now called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), are widely accepted for research purposes, efforts to transfer them to medical practice have been less successful. PMDD remains a contested disease construct. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an image classification technique that can be operated on the spectrogram of an audio recording. Using CNNs for bioacoustic classification negates the need for sophisticated feature extraction techniques; however, CNNs may be sensitive to the parameters used to create spectrograms. We used AlexNet to classify spectrograms of audio clips from 19 species of birdsong. We trained and tested AlexNet with the spectrograms and observed that mean classification accuracy ranged from 88.9\% to 96.9\% depending on the parameters used to create the spectrogram. Classification accuracy was highest when we used a composite of four spectrograms with different combinations of scales for frequency and amplitude. Classification accuracy also varied depending on the FFT window size of the spectrogram. Overall, our results suggest that optimal spectrogram parameters for CNN classification may differ from those used for human visualization or other classification approaches. We suggest that if spectrogram parameters are appropriately selected, classification accuracy similar to current state-of-the-art methods can be achieved using off-the-shelf software and without the need to extract domain-specific features.}

Recently, a related algorithm, called uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) has attracted substantial attention in the single-cell community. In Nature Biotechnology, Becht et al. argued that UMAP is preferable to t-SNE because it better preserves the global structure of the data and is more consistent across runs. Here we show that this alleged superiority of UMAP can be entirely attributed to different choices of initialization in the implementations used by Becht et al.: t-SNE implementations by default used random initialization, while the UMAP implementation used a technique called Laplacian eigenmaps to initialize the embedding. We show that UMAP with random initialization preserves global structure as poorly as t-SNE with random initialization, while t-SNE with informative initialization performs as well as UMAP with informative initialization. Hence, contrary to the claims of Becht et al., their experiments do not demonstrate any advantage of the UMAP algorithm per se, but rather warn against using random initialization.},

Antiquity 69, 197-214] proposed a model designed to show that larger population size facilitates cumulative cultural evolution toward higher skill levels. In this model, each newborn attempts to imitate the most highly skilled individual of the parental generation by directly-biased social learning, but the skill level he/she acquires deviates probabilistically from that of the exemplar (cultural parent). The probability that the skill level of the imitator exceeds that of the exemplar can be regarded as the innovation rate. After reformulating Henrich's model rigorously, we introduce an overlapping-generations analog based on the Moran model and derive an approximate formula for the expected change per generation of the highest skill level in the population. For large population size, our overlapping-generations model predicts a much larger effect of population size than Henrich's discrete-generations model. We then investigate by way of Monte Carlo simulations the case where each newborn chooses as his/her exemplar the most highly skilled individual from among a limited number of acquaintances. When the number of acquaintances is small relative to the population size, we find that a change in the innovation rate contributes more than a proportional change in population size to the cumulative cultural evolution of skill level. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

Bach and modified versions in which the hierarchical structure was rendered irregular whereas the local structure was kept intact. Brain electric responses differed between regular and irregular hierarchical structures, in both musicians and nonmusicians. This finding indicates that, when listening to music, humans apply cognitive processes that are capable of dealing with long-distance dependencies resulting from hierarchically organized syntactic structures. Our results reveal that a brain mechanism fundamental for syntactic processing is engaged during the perception of music, indicating that processing of hierarchical structure with nested nonlocal dependencies is not just a key component of human language, but a multidomain capacity of human cognition.},

The next step is for anthropologists to consider how their theories and methods can contribute to generation of empirical data to contribute to effective, ethical, and sustainable achievements for mental health worldwide. 3 Therefore, we propose five domains comprising a new agenda for anthropology to engage with global mental health. First, medical anthropologists should engage with policy makers, clinicians, and people with mental illness to combat human rights violations. Improving human rights for people with mental illness is a central focus of global mental health. 4 Anthropologists traditionally illuminate how institutions, practices, and beliefs affect institutionalisation in medical and correctional facilities, law-enforcement practices, community-based services, and psychiatric emergency services. Additionally, anthropologists have investigated discrimination related to mental health and other stigmatised disorders. The methods and theories developed from this work should focus on partnering with organisations addressing human rights and combating stigma and discrimination. Second, anthropological research about health systems is required to understand and inform treatment processes in mental health. We call for integration of anthropological research as a standard component of public health and clinical intervention programmes. Since social and economic systems involve resources and power, health systems research should fall within the remit of anthropology. One reason for the absence of focus on health systems is that anthropologists have rarely studied elites in positions of corporate and government power. This gap was identified in 1972 by Laura Nader, who called for " studying up " , referring to the tendency of anthropologists to focus studies on groups with lower socioeconomic status. 5 Studying up can identify institutional gaps in public health endeavors, as shown by},

Psychosocial stress was assessed using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS10). We observed that out of the 164 students who answered the questionnaire, students who reported premenstrual symptoms, irregular cycles and dysmenorrhoea severe enough to take medication had significantly higher mean PSS scores (p = 0.000, 0.025, 0.035, respectively). High stress (fourth quartile PSS score) was significantly associated with occurrence of premenstrual symptoms and dysmenorrhoea severe enough to take medication. Stress in medical students is associated with severe dysmenorrhoea, irregular cycles and premenstrual syndrome. This implies that interventions to reduce the stress can improve the menstrual health of medical students, thereby reducing future health risks and improving the quality of life.},

However, such methods generalize poorly across different behaviours and model systems and may miss important components of change. Here we present a more-general account of behavioural change that is based on nearest-neighbour statistics11\textendash 13, and apply it to song development in a songbird, the zebra finch3. First, we introduce the concept of `repertoire dating', whereby each rendition of a behaviour (for example, each vocalization) is assigned a repertoire time, reflecting when similar renditions were typical in the behavioural repertoire. Repertoire time isolates the components of vocal variability that are congruent with long-term changes due to vocal learning and development, and stratifies the behavioural repertoire into `regressions', `anticipations' and `typical renditions'. Second, we obtain a holistic, yet low-dimensional, description of vocal change in terms of a stratified `behavioural trajectory', revealing numerous previously unrecognized components of behavioural change on fast and slow timescales, as well as distinct patterns of overnight consolidation1,2,4,14,15~across the behavioral repertoire. We find that diurnal changes in regressions undergo only weak consolidation, whereas anticipations and typical renditions consolidate fully. Because of its generality, our nonparametric description of how behaviour evolves relative to itself\textemdash rather than to a potentially arbitrary, experimenter-defined goal2,3,14,16\textemdash appears well suited for comparing learning and change across behaviours and species17,18, as well as biological and artificial systems5.},

They also penetrated into the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia, but the geographical origin of these populations and the timing of their dispersal have remained elusive. Here we describe an archaeological assemblage from Chagyrskaya Cave, situated in the Altai foothills, where around 90,000 Middle Paleolithic artifacts and 74 Neanderthal remains have been recovered from deposits dating to between 59 and 49 thousand years ago (age range at 95.4\% probability). Environmental reconstructions suggest that the Chagyrskaya hominins were adapted to the dry steppe and hunted bison. Their distinctive toolkit closely resembles Micoquian assemblages from central and eastern Europe, including the northern Caucasus, more than 3,000 kilometers to the west of Chagyrskaya Cave. At other Altai sites, evidence of earlier Neanderthal populations lacking associated Micoquian-like artifacts implies two or more Neanderthal incursions into this region. We identify eastern Europe as the most probable ancestral source region for the Chagyrskaya toolmakers, supported by DNA results linking the Neanderthal remains with populations in northern Croatia and the northern Caucasus, and providing a rare example of a long-distance, intercontinental population movement associated with a distinctive Paleolithic toolkit.}

We show that this relationship is the result of a misspecified model that does not consider the temporal aspect of the data by presenting a similar but nonsensical relationship between the global annual mean sea level and lexical diversity. Given the fact that in the recent past, several studies were published that present surprising links between different economic, cultural, political and (socio-)demographical variables on the one hand and cultural or linguistic characteristics on the other hand, but seem to suffer from exactly this problem, we explain the cause of the misspecification and show that it has profound consequences. We demonstrate how simple transformation of the time series can often solve problems of this type and argue that the evaluation of the plausibility of a relationship is important in this context. We hope that our paper will help both researchers and reviewers to understand why it is important to use special models for the analysis of data with a natural temporal ordering.},

  abstract = {Researches on sequential vocalization often require analysis of vocalizations in long continuous sounds. In such studies as developmental ones or studies across generations in which days or months of vocalizations must be analyzed, methods for automatic recognition would be strongly desired. Although methods for automatic speech recognition for application purposes have been intensively studied, blindly applying them for biological purposes may not be an optimal solution. This is because, unlike human speech recognition, analysis of sequential vocalizations often requires accurate extraction of timing information. In the present study we propose automated systems suitable for recognizing birdsong, one of the most intensively investigated sequential vocalizations, focusing on the three properties of the birdsong. First, a song is a sequence of vocal elements, called notes, which can be grouped into categories. Second, temporal structure of birdsong is precisely controlled, meaning that temporal information is important in song analysis. Finally, notes are produced according to certain probabilistic rules, which may facilitate the accurate song recognition. We divided the procedure of song recognition into three sub-steps: local classification, boundary detection, and global sequencing, each of which corresponds to each of the three properties of birdsong. We compared the performances of several different ways to arrange these three steps. As results, we demonstrated a hybrid model of a deep convolutional neural network and a hidden Markov model was effective. We propose suitable arrangements of methods according to whether accurate boundary detection is needed. Also we designed the new measure to jointly evaluate the accuracy of note classification and boundary detection. Our methods should be applicable, with small modification and tuning, to the songs in other species that hold the three properties of the sequential vocalization.},

We furthermore find that in Neandertals, these changes lie on the common modern human haplotype, which previously was shown to have been subject to a selective sweep. These results suggest that these genetic changes and the selective sweep predate the common ancestor (which existed about 300,000-400,000 years ago) of modern human and Neandertal populations. This is in contrast to more recent age estimates of the selective sweep based on extant human diversity data. Thus, these results illustrate the usefulness of retrieving direct genetic information from ancient remains for understanding recent human evolution. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Starting as a problem of skewed distributions of binary tasks, this topic evolved way beyond this conception. With the expansion of machine learning and data mining, combined with the arrival of big data era, we have gained a deeper insight into the nature of imbalanced learning, while at the same time facing new emerging challenges. Data-level and algorithm-level methods are constantly being improved and hybrid approaches gain increasing popularity. Recent trends focus on analyzing not only the disproportion between classes, but also other difficulties embedded in the nature of data. New real-life problems motivate researchers to focus on computationally efficient, adaptive and real-time methods. This paper aims at discussing open issues and challenges that need to be addressed to further develop the field of imbalanced learning. Seven vital areas of research in this topic are identified, covering the full spectrum of learning from imbalanced data: classification, regression, clustering, data streams, big data analytics and applications, e.g., in social media and computer vision. This paper provides a discussion and suggestions concerning lines of future research for each of them.},

The great tit (Parus major) is a typical songbird in that song is primarily a male vocalisation and it is produced before and during the breeding season (that is, from January to May in southern England). We have shown that great tit song plays a part in territory maintenance by experiments in which we 'occupied' territories with loudspeakers after removing resident pairs1,2. New pairs seeking an empty space in which to settle moved into control areas more rapidly than into song-occupied territories. We report here on three experiments designed to study the effect of a varied song repertoire in territory maintenance. Each male great tit, in common with many other songbird species, has a repertoire of song variants some of which are usually shared between birds in a locality. In the great tit, repertoire size commonly varies between two and eight song types. In some species, for example the canary, elaborate repertoires seem to be favoured by sexual selection3,4, but we have found no evidence for this in the great tit (Table 1), in which pairing takes place before the spring peak of song. We therefore tested the possibility that repertoires enhance the effectiveness of song as a territorial display.},

The results suggest, therefore, that food-storing species of passerines have an enlarged hippocampal complex as a specialization associated with the use of a specialized memory capacity. Other life-history variables were examined and found not to be correlated with hippocampal volume. Some species of birds store large numbers offood items, each in a separate place, and use an accurate, long-lasting spatial memory to retrieve their stores (1-5). We show here that the hippocampal complex (dorsomedial forebrain) (6) of food-storing passerines is larger relative to body and brain size than that of nonstorers. Thus, across a range of species, a relationship has been found between the structure of a specific brain area outside sensory and motor areas and a specific behavior. METHODS We measured the volume of the hippocampal complex and striatum of52 individuals belonging to 35 species or subspecies distributed among 9 passerine families [taxonomy in this paper follows that of Sibley et al. (7) based on DNADNA hybrid-ization]. We defined the hippocampal complex as including the closely interconnected hippocampal and parahippocampal areas (6). The evidence from both embryological and connec-tivity studies (8-10) suggests that these two structures as a whole are homologous to the mammalian hippocampal com-plex, although the homology ofthe different subdivisions is not known. The behavioral consequences of damage to the avian hippocampal complex show that it is broadly functionally equivalent to the mammalian hippocampus in playing an important role in certain memory tasks, including those involving spatial memory (11-18). The avian hippocampal complex is a paired structure located adjacent to the midline of the dorsal telencephalon (19). It extends from the caudal limit of the striatum along approximately two-thirds of the},

Individual differences in social connections determine the overall group structure and have consequences for a variety of processes, including if and when individuals acquire information from conspecifics. Effects in the opposite direction, where information acquisition and transmission have consequences for social connections, are also likely to be widespread. However, these effects are typically overlooked. We propose that individuals who successfully learn about their environment become valuable social partners and become highly connected, leading to feedback-based dynamic relationships between social connections and information transmission. These dynamics have the potential to change our understanding of social evolution, including how selection acts on behavior and how sociality influences population-level processes.}

Social rejection is a critical risk factor for depression and it is said to increase interpersonal stress and thereby impairing social functioning. It is therefore critical to understand the neural correlates of social rejection in MDD. METHODS To this end, we scanned 15 medicated MDD and 17 healthy individuals during a modified cyberball passing game, where participants were exposed to increasing levels of social exclusion. Neural responses to increasing social exclusion were investigated and compared between groups. RESULTS We showed that compared to controls, MDD individuals exhibited greater amygdala, insula, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activation to increasing social exclusion and this correlated negatively with hedonic tone and self-esteem scores across all participants. CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results support the hypothesis that depression is associated with hyperactive response to social rejection. These findings highlight the importance of studying social interactions in depression, as they often lead to social withdrawal and isolation.},

Increasing evidence indicates that in utero BPA exposure affects sexual differentiation and behavior; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. We hypothesized that BPA may disrupt epigenetic programming of gene expression in the brain. Here, we provide evidence that maternal exposure during pregnancy to environmentally relevant doses of BPA (2, 20, and 200 \textmu g/kg/d) in mice induces sex-specific, dose-dependent (linear and curvilinear), and brain region-specific changes in expression of genes encoding estrogen receptors (ERs; ER{$\alpha$} and ER{$\beta$}) and estrogen-related receptor-{$\gamma$} in juvenile offspring. Concomitantly, BPA altered mRNA levels of epigenetic regulators DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and DNMT3A in the juvenile cortex and hypothalamus, paralleling changes in estrogen-related receptors. Importantly, changes in ER{$\alpha$} and DNMT expression in the cortex (males) and hypothalamus (females) were associated with DNA methylation changes in the ER{$\alpha$} gene. BPA exposure induced persistent, largely sex-specific effects on social and anxiety-like behavior, leading to disruption of sexually dimorphic behaviors. Although postnatal maternal care was altered in mothers treated with BPA during pregnancy, the effects of in utero BPA were not found to be mediated by maternal care. However, our data suggest that increased maternal care may partially attenuate the effects of in utero BPA on DNA methylation. Overall, we demonstrate that low-dose prenatal BPA exposure induces lasting epigenetic disruption in the brain that possibly underlie enduring effects of BPA on brain function and behavior, especially regarding sexually dimorphic phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Singing is a key element of songbirds' behavioral repertoire, particularly for males, which sing during the breeding season to defend resources against other males and to attract females. Different song traits may convey honest information about males' qualities or conditions, which may be used by females to select their mates. Traits under strong sexual selection have an important component of additive genetic variation (i.e., the main genetic inheritance from parents), and so relatively high heritability; therefore, it can be expected that song traits also do. Although the act of singing is an innate behavior, and thus, genetically determined, songbirds need to learn their songs and therefore the genetic contribution to song traits may be reduced by the effect of environmental factors. We tested this hypothesis in seven song traits recorded in the long-distance migratory bird, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). From a 23-year database (1992-2015), we obtained songs for 28 father-son pairs, and for each song trait we applied parent-offspring regressions to estimate heritability. The type of syllables sung are learned from tutors, and here we also determined the cultural contribution of fathers to the song repertoires of their sons, by quantifying the percentage of syllables that sons shared with their fathers, and compared this with what sons shared with other males in the population (e.g., neighbors). The heritabilities of song traits were highly variable (ranging from -0.22 to 0.56), but most of these were around zero and none of them were significant. These results indicate that the seven song traits are most likely determined by environmental factors. Sons shared more syllables with their fathers than with neighbors (21\% vs. 3\%), suggesting that fathers are important song tutors during the nestling period. We conclude that there is a cultural inheritance from fathers to their sons' syllable repertoires, but there is no strong evidence for a genetic contribution of fathers to the seven song traits studied.},

The theory of gene-culture coevolution is applied to this problem taking the specific case of the maintenance of song learning in birds. The interaction between genes underlying the filter for recognizing and learning conspecific song and the culturally transmitted songs themselves sets up an evolutionary force that may maintain vocal learning. We evaluate this hypothesis using a spatial simulation model. Our results suggest that selection that would maintain song learning exists over a wide range of conditions. Song learning may persist due to an evolutionary trap even though the average fitness in a population of learners may be lower than in a population of non-learners.},

We argue that examining how restrictive genetic predispositions are is a useful way of examining the evolutionary origin and maintenance of learning. Under neutral cultural evolution, where no cultural trait has any inherent advantage over another, there is selection in favour of less restrictive genes (genes that allow a wider range of signals to recognized). In contrast, cultural conformity (where the most common cultural trait is favoured) leads to selection in favour of more restrictive genes.},

Here the authors combine a computational method of comparing songs with statistical methods of assessing cluster structure to investigate this issue in a more quantitative manner. The authors first analyze song phonology and then examine song syntax at a population level in 3 species with very different song structure: chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs), zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata), and swamp sparrows (Melospiza georgiana). The authors used a dynamic time-warping algorithm to compare song elements, which closely matched the judgments of human observers. Clustering tendency and validation statistics showed that broad phonological categories existed in all 3 species, but these categories explained no more than half of the overall phonological variation. The authors developed a novel statistic to assess syntactical structure, which indicated that element transitions were not randomly distributed. In the clearest case, in chaffinches, this could be explained by syllables being linked to certain positions within the song. These results demonstrate measures of song organization that can be applied across species, enhancing the potential of comparative studies. \textcopyright{} 2010 American Psychological Association.},

Nevertheless, this flexibility often appears to be constrained, sometimes by preferences for learning certain traits over others, a phenomenon known as "biased" learning or transmission [1]. The sequential colonization of the Atlantic Islands by the chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) [2] provides a unique model system in which to investigate how the variability of a cultural trait has evolved. We used novel computational methods to analyze chaffinch song from twelve island and continental populations and to infer patterns of evolution in song structure. We found that variability of the subunits within songs ("syllables") differed moderately between populations but was not predicted by whether the population was continental or not. In contrast, we found that the sequencing of syllables within songs ("syntax") was less structured in island than continental populations and in fact decreased significantly after each colonization. Syntactical structure was very clear in the mainland European populations but was almost entirely absent in the most recently colonized island, Gran Canaria. Our results suggest that colonization leads to the progressive loss of a species-specific feature of song, syntactical structure. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Territorial males responded more aggressively and captive females performed more sexual displays in response to songs that are highly typical than to songs that are less typical. Previous studies have demonstrated that songbirds distinguish song types that are typical for their species, or for their population, from those that are not. Our results show that swamp sparrows also discriminate typical from less typical exemplars within learned song-type categories. In addition, our results suggest thatmore typical versions of song types function better, at least in male-female communication.

  abstract = {Some of the psychological abilities that underlie human speech are shared with other species. One hallmark of speech is that linguistic context affects both how speech sounds are categorized into phonemes, and how different versions of phonemes are produced. We here confirm earlier findings that swamp sparrows categorically perceive the notes that constitute their learned songs and then investigate how categorical boundaries differ according to context. We clustered notes according to their acoustic structure, and found statistical evidence for clustering into 10 population-wide note types. Examining how three related types were perceived, we found, in both discrimination and labeling tests, that an ``intermediate'' note type is categorized with a ``short'' type when it occurs at the beginning of a song syllable, but with a ``long'' type at the end of a syllable. In sum, three produced note-type clusters appear to be underlain by two perceived categories. Thus, in birdsong, as in human speech, categorical perception is context-dependent, and as is the case for human phonology, there is a complex relationship between underlying categorical representations and surface forms. Our results therefore suggest that complex phonology can evolve even in the absence of rich linguistic components, like syntax and semantics.},

  abstract = {Learned bird songs are often characterized by a high degree of variation between individuals and sometimes between populations, while at the same time maintaining species specificity. The evolution of such songs depends on the balance between plasticity and constraints. Captive populations provide an opportunity to examine signal variation and differentiation in detail, so we analyzed adult male zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) songs recorded from 13 populations across the world, including one sample of songs from wild-caught males in their native Australia. Cluster analysis suggested some, albeit limited, evidence that zebra finch song units belonged to universal, species-wide categories, linked to restrictions in vocal production and non-song parts of the vocal repertoire. Across populations, songs also showed some syntactical structure, although any song unit could be placed anywhere within the song. On the other hand, there was a statistically significant differentiation between populations, but the effect size was very small, and its communicative significance dubious. Our results suggest that variation in zebra finch songs within a population is largely determined by species-wide constraints rather than population-specific features. Although captive zebra finch populations have been sufficiently isolated to allow them to genetically diverge, there does not appear to have been any divergence in the genetically determined constraints that underlie song learning. Perhaps more surprising is the lack of locally diverged cultural traditions. Zebra finches serve as an example of a system where frequent learning errors may rapidly create within-population diversity, within broad phonological and syntactical constraints, and prevent the formation of long-term cultural traditions that allow populations to diverge.},

It remains unclear, however, what is required for social learning to give rise to stable traditions: what level of precision and what learning strategies are required. We address these questions by fitting models of cultural evolution to learned bird song. We recorded 615 swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana) song repertoires, and compared syllable frequency distributions to the output of individual-based simulations. We find that syllables are learned with an estimated error rate of 1.85\% and with a conformist bias in learning. This bias is consistent with a simple mechanism of overproduction and selective attrition. Finally, we estimate that syllable types could frequently persist for more than 500 years. Our results demonstrate conformist bias in natural animal behaviour and show that this, along with moderately precise learning, may support traditions whose stability rivals those of humans.},

The fluctuations were mainly synchronous with those of the blue tit, and also with those of the great tit in other woods in England and Holland. 2. The commonest clutch was nine, and in most years the brood-size which on average resulted in most surviving juveniles was 9-10, though it varied in different years between five and fourteen. 3. Clutch-size and the production-rate of nestlings were slightly lower at higher breeding densities. They had no apparent influence on the fluctuations in the breeding population. 4. The critical factor determining the population fluctuations was the mortality of the juveniles between leaving the nest and the beginning of winter, probably mainly in June. This mortality was correlated with the ensuing beechmast crop, presumably because both were affected by certain conditions in summer. 5. Predation and disease seem to have been unimportant, and the evidence suggests that the breeding density was not limited by territorial behaviour. Hence the chief density-dependent factor was probably food shortage, but this could not be studied in the great tit in Marley; the coal tit was probably limited by its winter food in conifer plantations.},

We adopted a discourse analytic approach to explore the question: If faking orgasm is often compulsory, how do women resist this practice and what does it mean when they do? Participants were 15 undergraduate students who ranged in age from 19 to 28. We identified the mobilization of several discursive patterns in their accounts. First, participants mobilized a ``future pleasures'' discourse to highlight the importance of resisting faking orgasm in order to increase their chances of experiencing genuine pleasure. Second, they positioned sexual satisfaction as an ``equal right'' to which they were entitled.

Several studies have mapped spatial differences in behaviour, revealing a mosaic of behavioural phenotypes within species. The dominant current approach attempts to determine whether this is cultural variation by excluding asocial learning, ecological or genetic factors. However, claims of animal cultures remain controversial because such comparisons are subject to weaknesses; thus, new approaches to isolating the influence of culture on behaviour are required. Here we suggest that, rather than attributing behaviour to explanatory categories, researchers would often be better advised to partition variance in behaviour to alternative sources. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Neither winter dominance position nor song were related to size (wing length, tarso-metatarsus length, weight). Singing capacity was not correlated with individual reproductive success in a single breeding season, using a rather limited data set. However, "better" singers (males which sing longer strophes, show less positive drift, and have larger song repertoires) survived better and had a higher individual lifetime reproductive success (on the basis of a male's recruited offspring of all breeding seasons). Our results show that there exist measurable differences whereby birds that are dominant in winter sing "better", survive longer, and produce more surviving offspring during their life time. We suggest that differences in male quality are the common cause (direct and indirect) of all these effects. \textcopyright{} 1986 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Birdsong is a classic example of a learned social behaviour. Song behaviour is also influenced by genetic factors, and understanding the relative contributions of genetic and environmental influences remains a major goal. In this study, we take advantage of captive zebra finch populations to examine variation in a population-level song trait: song variability. Song variability is of particular interest in the context of individual recognition and in terms of the neuro-developmental mechanisms that generate song novelty. We find that the Australian zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata castanotis (TGC) maintains higher song diversity than the Timor zebra finch T. g. guttata (TGG) even after experimentally controlling for early life song exposure, suggesting a genetic basis to this trait. Although wild-derived TGC were intermediate in song variability between domesticated TGC populations and TGG, the difference between domesticated and wild TGC was not statistically significant. The observed variation in song behaviour among zebra finch populations represents a largely untapped opportunity for exploring the mechanisms of social behaviour.},

Hypotheses about the evolution of song repertoires differ as to whether selection acts primarily on repertoire size itself or the ability to match songs of neighbours. We used a 16-channel acoustic location system to record neighbourhoods of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia melodia) during the dawn chorus. We asked whether males sing all songs with similar frequency as predicted by the Repertoire Size Hypothesis, whether males preferentially sing highly shared songs as predicted by the General Sharing Hypothesis, or whether use of highly shared songs is associated with phenotype as predicted by the Conditional Sharing Hypothesis. Contrary to the Repertoire Size Hypothesis, most males did not sing all songs equally often. Contrary to the General Sharing Hypothesis, we found no general tendency to overproduce highly shared songs. The degree to which males overproduced highly shared songs was repeatable across days, indicating consistent individual differences, and varied across neighbourhoods. Moreover, and consistent with the Conditional Sharing Hypothesis, older males were more likely to overproduce highly shared songs. If highly shared song is a conventional signal of aggression, with the threat of receiver retaliation maintaining honesty, older males may be more willing or able to risk conflict. Alternatively, males may learn which songs are effective signals for an area. Finally, age-related variation in vocal performance may shape the adaptive value of highly shared song. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

In songbirds (brown thrashers, Toxostoma rufum, and cardinals, Cardinalis cardinalis), direct observations of the biomechanical effects of contraction largely confirm the functions of the intrinsic syringeal muscles proposed from indirect studies. Contraction of the dorsal muscles, m. syringealis dorsalis (dS) and m. tracheobronchialis dorsalis, constricts the syringeal lumen and thus reduces airflow by adducting connective tissue masses, the medial (ML) and lateral (LL) labia. Activity of the medial portion of the dS appears to affect the position of the ML and, consequently, plays a previously undescribed role in aperture control. Under the experimental conditions used in this study, full constriction of the syringeal lumen could not be achieved by stimulating adductor muscles. Full closure may require simultaneous activation of extrinsic syringeal muscles or the supine positioning of the bird may have exerted excessive tension on the syrinx. Contraction of m. tracheobronchialis ventralis enlarges the syringeal lumen and thus increases airflow by abducting the LL but does not affect the ML. The largest syringeal muscle, m. syringealis ventralis, plays a minor role, if any, in direct aperture control and thus in gating airflow. In parrots (cockatiels, Nymphicus hollandicus), direct observations show that even during quiet respiration the lateral tympaniform membranes (LTMs) are partially adducted into the tracheal lumen to form a narrow slot. Contraction of the superficial intrinsic muscle, m. syringealis superficialis, adducts the LTMs further into the tracheal lumen but does not close the syringeal aperture fully. The intrinsic deep muscle, m. syringealis profundus, abducts the LTMs through cranio-laterad movement of a paired, protruding half-ring. The weakly developed extrinsic m. sternotrachealis seems to increase tension in the ipsilateral LTM but does not move it in or out of the syringeal lumen.}

  abstract = {Over recent years, several alternative relaxed clock models have been proposed in the context of Bayesian dating. These models fall in two distinct categories: uncorrelated and autocorrelated across branches. The choice between these two classes of relaxed clocks is still an open question. More fundamentally, the true process of rate variation may have both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations, suggesting that more sophisticated clock models unfolding over multiple time scales should ultimately be developed. Here, a mixed relaxed clock model is introduced, which can be mechanistically interpreted as a rate variation process undergoing short-term fluctuations on the top of Brownian long-term trends. Statistically, this mixed clock represents an alternative solution to the problem of choosing between autocorrelated and uncorrelated relaxed clocks, by proposing instead to combine their respective merits. Fitting this model on a dataset of 105 placental mammals, using both node-dating and tip-dating approaches, suggests that the two pure clocks, Brownian and white noise, are rejected in favour of a mixed model with approximately equal contributions for its uncorrelated and autocorrelated components. The tip-dating analysis is particularly sensitive to the choice of the relaxed clock model. In this context, the classical pure Brownian relaxed clock appears to be overly rigid, leading to biases in divergence time estimation. By contrast, the use of a mixed clock leads to more recent and more reasonable estimates for the crown ages of placental orders and superorders. Altogether, the mixed clock introduced here represents a first step towards empirically more adequate models of the patterns of rate variation across phylogenetic trees.This article is part of the themed issue 'Dating species divergences using rocks and clocks'.},

To reduce influence of digitization noise, as well as segmentation errors, the shapes are simplified by a novel process of digital curve evolution. To compute our similarity measure, we first establish the best possible correspondence of visual parts (without explicitly computing the visual parts). Then, the similarity between corresponding parts is computed and aggregated. We applied our similarity measure to shape matching of object contours in various image databases and compared it to well-known approaches in the literature. The experimental results justify that our shape matching procedure gives an intuitive shape correspondence and is stable with respect to noise distortions.},

Eight paintings, four with horizontal/vertical frames in the original and four with oblique frames, were presented in eight different orientations and rated for aesthetic appeal on a 7-point scale. There was a stronger preference for pictures presented so that their component lines were horizontal and vertical than for pictures presented with their component lines in an oblique orientation. In addition, subjects showed a preference for the original orientation, perhaps because rotation changes the lateral balance of the paintings as well as the orientation of the component lines. There was no overall preference for one frame orientation over another, but there was an interaction between frame orientation and component orientation, resulting in a preference for paintings where the components were parallel to the surrounding frame. It is suggested that the aesthetic oblique effect reported here is related to the oblique effect in orientation perception and the privileged access which horizontal and vertical lines have to the visual system. This offers a possible mechanism for aesthetic judgments of abstract patterns: we find pleasing those stimuli which are closely tuned to the properties of the human visual system.},

This effect was very robust, occurring with both landscape and portrait formats and over a variety of different styles and categories of paintings. There was also an interaction between line orientation and frame orientation with an increased use of vertical lines with portrait format paintings and an increased use of horizontal lines with landscape format. It is suggested that the basic finding of an orientation anisotropy in line selection is related to the oblique effect in line perception, the finding that horizontal and vertical lines are more readily perceived than oblique lines in a wide variety of situations. This supports the idea that stimuli like horizontal and vertical lines, which are preferentially processed by the visual system, are also aesthetically more powerful.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}As social animals, many primates use acoustic communication to maintain relationships. Vocal individuality has been documented in a diverse range of primate species and call types, many of which have presumably different functions. Auditory recognition of one's neighbors may confer a selective advantage if identifying conspecifics decreases the need to participate in costly territorial behaviors. Alternatively, vocal individuality may be nonadaptive and the result of a unique combination of genetics and environment. Pair-bonded primates, in particular, often participate in coordinated vocal duets that can be heard over long distances by neighboring conspecifics. In contrast to adult calls, infant vocalizations are short-range and used for intragroup communication. Here, we provide two separate but complementary analyses of vocal individuality in distinct call types of coppery titi monkeys (\emph{Plecturocebus cupreus}) to test whether individuality occurs in call types from animals of different age classes with presumably different functions. We analyzed 600 trill vocalizations from 30 infants and 169 pulse-chirp duet vocalizations from 30 adult titi monkeys. We predicted that duet contributions would exhibit a higher degree of individuality than infant trills, given their assumed function for long-distance, intergroup communication. We estimated 7 features from infant trills and 16 features from spectrograms of adult pulse-chirps, then used discriminant function analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation to classify individuals. We correctly classified infants with 48\% accuracy and adults with 83\% accuracy. To further investigate variance in call features, we used a multivariate variance components model to estimate variance partitioning in features across two levels: within- and between-individuals. Between-individual variance was the most important source of variance for all features in adults, and three of four features in infants. We show that pulse-chirps of adult titi monkey duets are individually distinct, and infant trills are less individually distinct, which may be due to the different functions of the vocalizations.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

One of the major drawback regarding musical studies is the lack of suitable coded musical data that can be analysed using such evolutionary tools. Here we present for the first time an original set of musical data coded in a way that enables construction of trees classically used in evolutionary approaches. Using phylogenetic methods, we test two competing theories on musical evolution: vertical versus horizontal transmission. We show that, contrary to what is currently believed, vertical transmission plays a key role in shaping musical diversity. The signal of vertical transmission is particularly strong for intrinsic musical characters such as metrics, rhythm, and melody. Our findings reveal some of the evolutionary mechanisms at play for explaining musical diversity and open a new field of investigation in musical evolution.},

While this is often attributed to events that took place in the early 1990s, consciousness studies today are a continuation of research that started in the late 19th century and that continued throughout the 20th century. From the beginning, the effort built on studies of animals to reveal basic principles of brain organization and function, and of human patients to gain clues about consciousness itself. Particularly important and our focus here is research in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s involving three groups of patients\textemdash amnesia, split brain, and blindsight. Across all three groups, a similar pattern of results was found\textemdash the patients could respond appropriately to stimuli that they denied seeing (or in the case of amnesiacs, having seen before). These studies paved the way for the current wave of research on consciousness. The field is, in fact, still grappling with the implications of the findings showing that the ability to consciously know and report the identity of a visual stimulus can be dissociated in the brain from the mechanisms that underlie the ability to behave in a meaningful way to the same stimulus.}

Both the Mozart effect as well as the arousal-mood-hypothesis indicate that background music can potentially benefit learning outcomes. While the Mozart effect assumes a direct influence of background music on cognitive abilities, the arousal-mood-hypothesis assumes a mediation effect over arousal and mood. However, the seductive detail effect indicates that seductive details such as background music worsen learning. Moreover, as working memory capacity has a crucial influence on learning with seductive details, we also included the learner\textasciiacute s working memory capacity as a factor in our study. We tested 81 college students using a between-subject design with half of the sample listening to two pop songs while learning a visual text and the other half learning in silence. We included working memory capacity in the design as a continuous organism variable. Arousal and mood scores before and after learning were collected as potential mediating variables. To measure learning outcomes we tested recall and comprehension. We did not find a mediation effect between background music and arousal or mood on learning outcomes. In addition, for recall performance there were no main effects of background music or working memory capacity, nor an interaction effect of these factors. However, when considering comprehension we did find an interaction between background music and working memory capacity: the higher the learners\textasciiacute{} working memory capacity, the better they learned with background music.

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2018 Lehmann and Seufert. This study investigates the possibilities of fostering learning based on differences in recall and comprehension after learning with texts which were presented in one of three modalities: either in a spoken, written, or sung version. All three texts differ regarding their processing, especially when considering working memory. Overall, we assume the best recall performance after learning with the written text and the best comprehension performance after learning with the sung text, respectively, compared to both other text modalities. We also analyzed whether the melody of the sung material functions as a mnemonic aid for the learners in the sung text condition. If melody and text of the sung version are closely linked, presentation of the melody during the post-test phase could foster text retrieval. 108 students either learned from a sung text performed by a professional singer, a printed text, or the same text read out loud. Half of the participants worked on the post-test while listening to the melody used for the musical learning material and the other half did not listen to a melody. The written learning modality led to significantly better recall than with the spoken (d = 0.97) or sung text (d = 0.78). However, comprehension after learning with the sung modality was significantly superior compared to when learning with the written learning modality (d = 0.40). Reading leads to more focus on details, which is required to answer recall questions, while listening fosters a general understanding of the text, leading to higher levels of comprehension. Listening to the melody during the post-test phase negatively affected comprehension, irrespective of the modality during the learning phase. This can be explained by the seductive detail effect, as listening to the melody during the post-test phase may distract learners from their main task. In closing, theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {In animal societies, identity signals are common, mediate interactions within groups, and allow individuals to discriminate group-mates from out-group competitors. However, individual recognition becomes increasingly challenging as group size increases and as signals must be transmitted over greater distances. Group vocal signatures may evolve when successful in-group/out-group distinctions are at the crux of fitness-relevant decisions, but group signatures alone are insufficient when differentiated within-group relationships are important for decision-making. Spotted hyenas are social carnivores that live in stable clans of less than 125 individuals composed of multiple unrelated matrilines. Clan members cooperate to defend resources and communal territories from neighbouring clans and other mega carnivores; this collective defence is mediated by long-range (up to 5 km range) recruitment vocalizations, called whoops. Here, we use machine learning to determine that spotted hyena whoops contain individual but not group signatures, and that fundamental frequency features which propagate well are critical for individual discrimination. For effective clan-level cooperation, hyenas face the cognitive challenge of remembering and recognizing individual voices at long range. We show that serial redundancy in whoop bouts increases individual classification accuracy and thus extended call bouts used by hyenas probably evolved to overcome the challenges of communicating individual identity at long distance.},

  abstract = {Although communicative complexity is often predicted to correlate with social complexity in animal societies, few studies have employed large-scale comparative analyses to test whether socially complex species have more complex systems of communication. I tested this social complexity hypothesis in birds (Class: Aves) using the large amount of natural history information that describes both vocal repertoire and social system in these species. To do so, I marshalled data from primary and secondary records of avian vocal repertoires (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 253), and for each of the species in the dataset I recorded the reported repertoire size and associated species information. Using phyloge-netic comparative methods, I found that cooperative breeding was a strong and repeatable predictor of vocal repertoire size, while other social variables, e.g. group size and group stability, had little or no influence on repertoire size. Importantly, repertoire sizes expanded concurrently with the evolution of cooperative breeding, suggesting a direct link between these two traits. Cooperatively breeding species devoted significantly more of their repertoire to contact calls and alarm calls. Overall, these results therefore lend support to the hypothesis that social complexity via behavioural coordination leads to increases in vocal complexity.},

In the smaller repertoires of three or four songs, low order Markov chain models fitted the data. 9 of the 10 sequences so examined were first-order, and the last was second-order. Larger repertoires of 6 and 8 songs were hierarchical in organization with subsets of songs having independent sequencing rules. Most samples of singing were stationary in their transition rules over periods of several days: non-stationarity was sometimes associated with a change in the number of songs forming the sequence, or in repetitions of songs. We examine causal models of song sequencing and conclude that our results generally favor competition models, although some sequential dependencies may also apply. Hierarchical organization in the serial repertoires of American redstarts may reflect developmental influences rather than effects of repertoire size itself. 1993 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

Here, in the largest longitudinal pediatric neuroimaging study reported to date (829 scans from 387 subjects, ages 3 to 27 years), we demonstrate the importance of examining size-by-age trajectories of brain development rather than group averages across broad age ranges when assessing sexual dimorphism. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we found robust male/female differences in the shapes of trajectories with total cerebral volume peaking at age 10.5 in females and 14.5 in males. White matter increases throughout this 24-year period with males having a steeper rate of increase during adolescence. Both cortical and subcortical gray matter trajectories follow an inverted U shaped path with peak sizes 1 to 2 years earlier in females. These sexually dimorphic trajectories confirm the importance of longitudinal data in studies of brain development and underline the need to consider sex matching in studies of brain development. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) are associated with characteristic behavioral and cognitive phenotypes, although the degree to which specific individuals are affected can fall within a wide range. Understanding the effects of different dosages of sex chromosome genes on brain development may help to understand the basis for functional differences in affected individuals. It may also be informative regarding how sex chromosomes contribute to typical sexual differentiation. Studies of 47,XXY males make up the bulk of the current literature of neuroimaging studies in individuals with supernumerary sex chromosomes, with a few small studies or case reports of the other SCAs. Findings in 47,XXY males typically include decreased gray and white matter volumes, with most pronounced effects in the frontal and temporal lobes. Functional studies have shown evidence of decreased lateralization. Although the hypogonadism typically found in 47,XXY males may contribute to the decreased brain volume, the observation that 47,XXX females also show decreased brain volume in the presence of normal pubertal maturation suggests a possible direct dosage effect of X chromosome genes. Additional X chromosomes, such as in 49,XXXXY males, are associated with more markedly decreased brain volume and increased incidence of white matter hyperintensities. The limited data regarding effects of having two Y chromosomes (47,XYY) do not find significant differences in brain volume, although there are some reports of increased head size.},

Based on animal data, it has long been believed that sexual differentiation of the brain is primarily linked to organizational effects of fetal testosterone. This view is, however, in question as more recent data show the presence of sex differences before the onset of testosterone production. The present study focuses on the impact that sex chromosomes might have on these differences. Utilizing the inherent differences in sex and X-chromosome dosage among XXY males, XY males, and XX females, comparative voxel-based morphometry was conducted using sex hormones and sex chromosomes as covariates. Sex differences in the cerebellar and precentral gray matter volumes (GMV) were found to be related to X-chromosome dosage, whereas sex differences in the amygdala, the parahippocamus, and the occipital cortex were linked to testosterone levels. An increased number of sex chromosomes was associated with reduced GMV in the amygdala, caudate, and the temporal and insular cortices, with increased parietal GMV and reduced frontotemporal white matter volume. No selective, testosterone independent, effect of the Y-chromosome was detected. Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that programming of the motor cortex and parts of cerebellum is mediated by processes linked to X-escapee genes, which do not have Y-chromosome homologs, and that programming of certain limbic structures involves testosterone and X-chromosome escapee genes with Y-homologs.},

Given that federal food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), aim to alleviate food insecurity, there may be heterogeneity in the association between food insecurity and depression by SNAP participation status. OBJECTIVE: With the use of data from the 2005-2010 NHANES, we examined the associations between household food security and depression and whether these differed by SNAP participation. METHODS: The study population was restricted to 3518 adults with household incomes /=3 was considered food insecure. Depression was assessed with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and was defined as a score of {$>$}/=10. Multivariate logistic regression models examined the associations between food insecurity and depression, adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of depression was 9.3\%, ranging from 6.7\% among SNAP nonparticipants to 12.8\% among SNAP participants. For every depressive symptom, there was a dose-response relation, such that a higher prevalence was observed with worsening food insecurity. After multivariate adjustment, food insecurity was positively associated with depression (P-trend {$<$} 0.0001), but SNAP participation modified this relation (P-interaction = 0.03). Among low-income, eligible nonparticipants, very low food security was significantly associated with higher odds of depression (OR: 5.10; 95\% CI: 3.09, 8.41). Among SNAP participants, very low food security was also associated with higher odds of depression but at a lower magnitude (OR: 2.21; 95\% CI: 1.54, 3.17). CONCLUSION: The complex relation between food insecurity and mental health may vary on the basis of SNAP participation status. Programmatic efforts to address the risk of depression among their beneficiaries may positively affect the mental health of low-income adults.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Spermatozoal uptake, facilitated by uterine contractions induced by oxytocin at orgasm during coitus, has been a long term concept. Studies attempting its support, however, have been poorly examined especially in the context of the changes in the female genital tract activated by sexual arousal. AIM To examine experimental support for the concept. METHODS Using a variety of search engines, mainly peer reviewed articles and un-reviewed books were examined relating to sperm transport and function in the human female genital tract in the absence and presence of arousal to orgasm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Identifying evidence-based data to support authority-based opinion. RESULTS All the experimental observations of sperm or model substitute's transport have been undertaken in women who were not sexually aroused. They fail to take into account that arousal creates vaginal tenting lifting the cervico-uterine complex into the false pelvis away from the ejaculated semen. This delays sperm uptake and transport making conclusions from these observations invalid in relation to transport during coitus. Studies injecting oxytocin have not used women in their sexually aroused state and used supraphysiological doses unlikely to be comparable with coitus and orgasm. The proposal that the transport of extra sperm by oxytocin-induced uterine contractions at orgasm is needed to facilitate fertility ignores possible harm from increased sperm numbers creating polyspermy and sperm enzyme release causing ovum degeneration, leading to decreased fertility. The role of sperm motility in their uptake from the vagina into the cervix as opposed to en bloc transfer through uterine archimyometrial-mediated transport in the absence of orgasm is at present unresolvable because of conflicting studies. CONCLUSION The bulk of the reported evidence favors the conclusion that the female orgasm, with its concomitant central release of oxytocin, has little or no effective role in the transport of spermatozoa in natural human coitus.},

Protagonists are committed to substantive positions regarding (1) empirical questions concerning (for example) the properties and prevalence of systems of epigenetic inheritance; (2) historical characterizations of the modern synthesis; and (3) conceptual/philosophical matters concerning (among other things) the nature of evolutionary processes, and the relationship between selection and adaptation. With these different aspects of the debate in view, it is possible to demonstrate the range of cross-cutting positions on offer when well-informed evolutionists consider their stance on the EES. This overview of the multiple dimensions of debate also enables clarification of two philosophical elements of the EES debate, regarding the status of niche-construction and the role of selection in explaining adaptation. Finally, it points the way to a possible resolution of the EES debate, via a pragmatic approach to evolutionary enquiry.}

This hyperacuity performance, which we refer to as implicit orientation discrimination, shares most of its properties with the orientation discrimination of explicit lines, suggesting a category of orientation processing whose neural mechanisms are related to those involved in the processing of straight contours and those underlying the detection of axes of symmetry. Strong binding effects between the components of the figures were demonstrated and their temporal interactions were also investigated. Our results have implications for possible neural interactions early in the cortical visual stream.},

  abstract = {The details of oriented visual stimuli are better resolved when they are horizontal or vertical rather than oblique. This "oblique effect" has been confirmed in numerous behavioral studies in humans and to some extent in animals. However, investigations of its neural basis have produced mixed and inconclusive results, presumably due in part to limited sample sizes. We have used a database to analyze a population of 4,418 cells in the cat's striate cortex to determine possible differences as a function of orientation. We find that both the numbers of cells and the widths of orientation tuning vary as a function of preferred orientation. Specifically, more cells prefer horizontal and vertical orientations compared with oblique angles. The largest population of cells is activated by orientations close to horizontal. In addition, orientation tuning widths are most narrow for cells preferring horizontal orientations. These findings are most prominent for simple cells tuned to high spatial frequencies. Complex cells and simple cells tuned to low spatial frequencies do not exhibit these anisotropies. For a subset of simple cells from our population (n = 104), we examined the relative contributions of linear and nonlinear mechanisms in shaping orientation tuning curves. We find that linear contributions alone do not account for the narrower tuning widths at horizontal orientations. By modeling simple cells as linear filters followed by static expansive nonlinearities, our analysis indicates that horizontally tuned cells have a greater nonlinear component than those tuned to other orientations. This suggests that intracortical mechanisms play a major role in shaping the oblique effect.},

  abstract = {FOXP2 is a transcription factor implicated in the development and neural control of orofacial coordination, particularly with respect to vocalisation. Observations that orthologues show almost no variation across vertebrates yet differ by two amino acids between humans and chimpanzees have led to speculation that recent evolutionary changes might relate to the emergence of language. Echolocating bats face especially challenging sensorimotor demands, using vocal signals for orientation and often for prey capture. To determine whether mutations in the FoxP2 gene could be associated with echolocation, we sequenced FoxP2 from echolocating and non-echolocating bats as well as a range of other mammal species. We found that contrary to previous reports, FoxP2 is not highly conserved across all nonhuman mammals but is extremely diverse in echolocating bats. We detected divergent selection (a change in selective pressure) at FoxP2 between bats with contrasting sonar systems, suggesting the intriguing possibility of a role for FoxP2 in the evolution and development of echolocation. We speculate that observed accelerated evolution of FoxP2 in bats supports a previously proposed function in sensorimotor coordination.},

However, its intrinsic neural mechanism is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to assess abnormal spontaneous brain activity and to explicate the intricate neural mechanism of PMS using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). Materials and Methods: The data of 20 PMS patients (PMS group) and 21 healthy controls (HC group) were analyzed by regional homogeneity (ReHo) method during the late luteal phase of menstrual cycle. In addition, all the participants were asked to complete a daily record of severity of problems (DRSP) questionnaire. Results: Compared with HC group, the results showed that PMS group had increased ReHo mainly in the bilateral precuneus, left inferior temporal cortex (ITC), right inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and left middle frontal cortex (MFC) and decreased ReHo in the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) at the luteal phase. Moreover, the PMS group had higher DRSP scores, and the DRSP scores positively correlated with ReHo in left MFC and negatively correlated with ReHo in the right ACC. Conclusion: Our results suggest that abnormal spontaneous brain activity is found in PMS patients and the severity of symptom is specifically related to the left MFC and right ACC. The present findings may be beneficial to explicate the intricate neural mechanism of PMS.},

This leaves the question whether current music information retrieval approaches can also be applied to collections of non-Western and in particular ethnic music with completely different characteristics and requirements. In this work we analyze the performance of a range of automatic audio description algorithms on three music databases with distinct characteristics, specifically a Western music collection used previously in research benchmarks, a collection of Latin American music with roots in Latin American culture, but following Western tonality principles, as well as a collection of field recordings of ethnic African music. The study quantitatively shows the advantages and shortcomings of different feature representations extracted from music on the basis of classification tasks, and presents an approach to visualize, access and interact with ethnic music collections in a structured way. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Cryptococcus neoformans is a globally distributed human fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients. It has a defined sexual cycle involving haploid cells of alpha and a mating types, yet the vast majority of environmental and clinical isolates are alpha (ref. 3). Sexual recombination is normally expected to occur between isolates of opposite mating type in organisms with two mating types (or sexes). How sexual reproductive potential can be maintained in an organism with a largely unisexual, nearly clonal population genetic structure is unknown. One clue, however, is that alpha strains undergo fruiting, a process that resembles sexual mating but is thought to be strictly mitotic and asexual. We report here that hallmarks of mating occur during fruiting, including diploidization and meiosis. Pheromone response pathway elements and the key meiotic regulator Dmc1 are required for efficient fruiting. Furthermore, fusion and meiosis can occur between non-isogenic alpha strains, enabling genetic exchange. These studies reveal how sexual reproduction can occur between partners of the same mating type. These findings have implications for the evolution of microbial pathogens, as well as for parthenogenesis, cell fusion events and transitions between self-fertilizing and outcrossing modes of reproduction observed in both fungi and other kingdoms.},

  abstract = {The human brain displays stereotyped and early emerging patterns of cortical asymmetry in health. It is unclear if these asymmetries are highly sensitive to genetic and environmental variation or fundamental features of the brain that can survive severe developmental perturbations. To address this question, we mapped cortical thickness (CT) asymmetry in a group of genetically defined disorders known to impact CT development. Participants included 137 youth with one of five sex-chromosome aneuploidies [SCAs; XXX (n = 28), XXY (n = 58), XYY (n = 26), XXYY (n = 20), and XXXXY (n = 5)], and 169 age-matched typically developing controls (80 female). In controls, we replicated previously reported rightward inferior frontal and leftward lateral parietal CT asymmetry. These opposing frontoparietal CT asymmetries were broadly preserved in all five SCA groups. However, we also detected foci of shifting CT asymmetry with aneuploidy, which fell almost exclusively within regions of significant CT asymmetry in controls. Specifically, X-chromosome aneuploidy accentuated normative rightward inferior frontal asymmetries, while Y-chromosome aneuploidy reversed normative rightward medial prefrontal and lateral temporal asymmetries. These findings indicate that (1) the stereotyped normative pattern of opposing frontoparietal CT asymmetry arises from developmental mechanisms that can withstand gross chromosomal aneuploidy and (2) X and Y chromosomes can exert focal, nonoverlapping and directionally opposed influences on CT asymmetry within cortical regions of significant asymmetry in health. Our study attests to the resilience of developmental mechanisms that support the global patterning of CT asymmetry in humans, and motivates future research into the molecular bases and functional consequences of sex chromosome dosage effects on CT asymmetry.},

Modern sound analysis approaches allow investigation of developmental song learning across multiple time scales. Combined with novel methods that allow experimental control of vocal changes, it is now possible to test hypotheses about mechanisms of vocal learning. Further, song analysis can be done at the population level across generations to track cultural evolution and multigenerational behavioral processes. Complementing the investigation of song development with noninvasive brain imaging technology makes it now possible to study behavioral dynamics at multiple levels side by side with developmental changes in brain connectivity and in auditory responses.},

Two explanations have been proposed to account for symmetry preferences: (i) the evolutionary advantage view, which posits that symmetry advertises mate quality and (ii) the perceptual bias view, which posits that symmetry preferences are a consequence of greater ease of processing symmetrical images in the visual system. Here, we show that symmetry preferences are greater when face images are upright than when inverted. This is evidence against a simple perceptual bias view, which suggests symmetry preference should be constant across orientation about a vertical axis. We also show that symmetry is preferred even in familiar faces, a finding that is unexpected by perceptual bias views positing that symmetry is only attractive because it represents a familiar prototype of that particular class of stimuli.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many animals both display and assess multiple signals. Two prominently studied traits are symmetry and sexual dimorphism, which, for many animals, are proposed cues to heritable fitness benefits. These traits are associated with other potential benefits, such as fertility. In humans, the face has been extensively studied in terms of attractiveness. Faces have the potential to be advertisements of mate quality and both symmetry and sexual dimorphism have been linked to the attractiveness of human face shape. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show that measurements of symmetry and sexual dimorphism from faces are related in humans, both in Europeans and African hunter-gatherers, and in a non-human primate. Using human judges, symmetry measurements were also related to perceived sexual dimorphism. In all samples, symmetric males had more masculine facial proportions and symmetric females had more feminine facial proportions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings support the claim that sexual dimorphism and symmetry in faces are signals advertising quality by providing evidence that there must be a biological mechanism linking the two traits during development. Such data also suggests that the signalling properties of faces are universal across human populations and are potentially phylogenetically old in primates.},

  abstract = {Symmetry and masculinity in human faces have been proposed to be cues to the quality of the owner. Accordingly, symmetry is generally found attractive in male and female faces, and femininity is attractive in female faces. Women's preferences for male facial masculinity vary in ways that may maximize genetic benefits to women's offspring. Here we examine same- and opposite-sex preferences for both traits (Study 1) and intercorrelations between preferences for symmetry and sexual dimorphism in faces (Study 1 and Study 2) using computer-manipulated faces. For symmetry, we found that male and female judges preferred symmetric faces more when judging faces of the opposite-sex than when judging same-sex faces. A similar pattern was seen for sexual dimorphism (i.e., women preferred more masculine male faces than men did), but women also showed stronger preferences for femininity in female faces than men reported. This suggests that women are more concerned with female femininity than are men. We also found that in women, preferences for symmetry were positively correlated with preferences for masculinity in male faces and that in men preferences for symmetry were positively correlated with preferences for femininity in female faces. These latter findings suggest that symmetry and sexual dimorphism advertise a common quality in faces or that preferences for these facial cues are dependent on a common quality in the judges. Collectively, our findings support the view that preferences for symmetry and sexual dimorphism are related to mechanisms involved in sexual selection and mate choice rather than functionless by-products of other perceptual mechanisms.},

  abstract = {As one of the classic models that describe the belief dynamics over social networks, a non-Bayesian social learning model assumes that members in the network possess accurate signal knowledge through the process of Bayesian inference. In order to make the non-Bayesian social learning model more applicable to human and animal societies, this paper extended this model by assuming the existence of private signal structure bias. Each social member in each time step uses an imperfect signal knowledge to form its Bayesian part belief and then incorporates its neighbors' beliefs into this Bayesian part belief to form a new belief report. First, we investigated the intrinsic learning ability of an isolated agent and deduced the conditions that the signal structure needs to satisfy for this isolated agent to make an eventually correct decision. According to these conditions, agents' signal structures were further divided into three different types, "conservative," "radical," and "negative." Then, we switched the context from isolated agents to a connected network; our propositions and simulations show that the conservative agents are the dominant force for the social network to learn the real state, while the other two types might prevent the network from successful learning. Although fragilities do exist in non-Bayesian social learning mechanism, "be more conservative" and "avoid overconfidence" could be effective strategies for each agent in the real social networks to collectively improve social learning processes and results.}

Juvenile chipping sparrow males develop five to seven potential precursor songs; the normal development of these songs requires intact hearing but not imitation from external models. The potential precursor songs conform with general species-typical song parameters but differ from the song of wild, adult territorial males. As chipping sparrow males return from migration to start their first breeding season, they settle close to an older adult. The young male then stops producing all but one of its precursor songs, retaining the one that most resembles that of its neighbor. This single song then becomes more variable and, in a matter of days, is altered to closely match the neighbor's song. This elegant solution ensures species specificity and promptness of imitation. \textcopyright{} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

How this pattern arises remains unclear though. One prevailing idea is that songbirds adjust song frequencies to environmental noise profiles through developmental plasticity via vocal learning. However, the conclusions of previous studies testing this hypothesis are inconsistent. Here we report the findings from two song learning experiments with zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata), in which we exposed young birds to anthropogenic noise during their sensitive vocal learning period. Unlike previous studies that addressed this issue, we did not use constant synthetic noise but natural urban noise with its typical amplitude fluctuations that was broadcast at realistic sound levels. We found that noise-exposed males in neither experiment developed higher pitched songs compared to control males. This suggests that the natural fluctuations between higher and lower noise levels in cities may allow young birds to exploit relatively quiet moments to hear their tutors and themselves, permitting them to make accurate copies of even low-frequency song elements.},

Gould's greatest contribution to science is a revised version of the theory of evolution which offers today a useful framework for understanding progress in many evolutionary fields. His intuitions about the conjunction of evolution and development, the role of ecological factors in speciation, the multi-level interpretation of the units of selection, and the interplay between functional pressures and constraints all represent fruitful lines of experimental research. His opposition to the progressive representations of evolution, the gene-centered view of natural history, or the adaptationist ``just-so stories'' has also left its mark on current biology. In May 2012, at the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti in Venice, an international panel of scientists and philosophers discussed Stephen J. Gould's legacy, ten years after his death. This book presents a selection of those contributions, chosen for their interest and importance. A broad range of themes are covered: Gould's contribution to evolutionary theory, including the concept of punctuated equilibria and the importance of his pluralism; the Gouldian view of genome and development; Gould's legacy in anthropology; and, finally, the significance of his thought for the human sciences.This book provides a fascinating appraisal of the cultural legacy of one of the world's greatest popular writers in the life sciences. This is the first time that scientists including some of Gould's personal friends and co-authors of papers of momentous importance such as Niles Eldredge have come together to strike a balanced view of Gould's intellectual heritage.},

  abstract = {Stephen J. Gould's concern for the wide variety of explanations for evolutionary change was one of his chief intellectual contributions. In one of his most famous papers, ``The Spandrels of San Marco'', named in honor of Venice's own most gloried church, and which he co-authored with Richard C. Lewontin, he emphasized the importance of historical, correlational, byproduct, and phyletic evolutionary explanations, and contrasted these with adaptationist explanations. In this Article, I take a more formal approach to discussing Gould's analysis of evolutionary explanations, now 33 years later. My analysis rests on the ``logic of research questions'', and contrasts a ``methodological adaptationist'' approach, to what I call the ``evolutionary factors'' approach. In the former, the key research question is: ``What is the function of this trait?'' while in the latter, the research question is: ``what evolutionary factors account for the form and distribution of this trait?'' I use my case study on the evolution of the female orgasm, which Gould defended in his column, and was one of his favorite examples, to illustrate how the methodological adaptationist approach can lead scientists astray. (Reports of a serious challenge to the byproduct account, based on recent poorly-designed twin studies, are unsupportable.) Biases induced by methodological adaptationism have led biologists to a failure to compare the byproduct hypothesis against an adaptive one with regard to the evidence. Perhaps, then, it is past time to take Gould's advice, and reevaluate whether methodological adaptationism is truly as benign as it is commonly assumed to be.},

The hypothesis that the structure of bird song is physiologically constrained remains controversial. We tested for evidence of performance constraints in Adelaide's warblers (Setophaga adelaidae) songs. At the note level, we identified three trade-offs with well-defined limits. At the song level, we identified two trade-offs, but their limits were less well-defined than the note-level limits. Trade-offs at both levels suggest that song structure is constrained by limits to the speed of both frequency modulation (while vocalizing and between notes) and respiration. Individual males experience the same trade-offs that characterize the population, but the intensity of those trade-offs varies among individuals. Performance metrics derived from the observed limits to performance varied moderately among individuals and strongly among song types. Note-level performance metrics were positively skewed, as predicted by the hypothesis that this population has experienced positive selection for constrained performance. We conclude that physiological limits on frequency modulation and respiration constrain song structure in male Adelaide's warblers. Further work is needed to determine whether receivers respond to natural levels of variation in performance, and whether performance correlates with singer quality.}

In the family of titmice and chickadees (Paridae), one species, the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), shows the typical pattern of seasonal changes, while another species, the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus), shows, at best, very reduced seasonal changes in the SCS. To test whether this pattern holds up in the two Parid lineages to which these two species belong, and to rule out that the differences in seasonal patterns observed were due to differences in geography or laboratory, we compared the seasonal patterns in two song system nuclei volumes (HVC and Area X) in willow tits (Poecile montanus), closely related to black-capped chickadees, and in great tits (Parus major), more closely related to blue tits, from the same area around Oulu, Finland. Both species had larger gonads in spring than during the rest of the year. Great tit males had a larger HVC in spring than at other times of the year, but their Area X did not change in size. Willow tits showed no seasonal change in HVC or Area X size, despite having much larger gonads in spring than the great tits. Our findings suggest that the song system of willow tits and their relatives may be involved in learning and producing nonsong social vocalizations. Since these vocalizations are used year-round, there may be a year-round demand on the song system. The great tit and blue tit HVC may change seasonally because the demand is only placed on the song system during the breeding season, since they only produce learned vocalizations during this time. We suggest that changes were not observed in Area X because its main role is in song learning, and there is evidence that great tits do not learn new songs after their first year of life. Further study is required to determine whether our hypothesis about the role of the song system in the learned, nonsong vocalizations of the willow tit and chickadee is correct, and to test our hypothesis about the role of Area X in the great tit song system.},

  abstract = {In this pathbreaking book, a well-known feminist and sociologist - who is also the Founding Editor of Gender \& Society - challenges our most basic assumptions about gender. Judith Lorber views gender as wholly a product of socialization subject to human agency, organization, and interpretation. In her new paradigm, gender is an institution comparable to the economy, the family, and religion in its significance and consequences. Drawing on many schools of feminist scholarship and on research from anthropology, history, sociology, social psychology, sociolinguistics, and cultural studies, Lorber explores different paradoxes of gender: why we speak of only two "opposite sexes" when there is such a variety of sexual behaviors and relationships; why transvestites, transsexuals, and hermaphrodites do not affect the conceptualization of two genders and two sexes in Western societies; why most of our cultural images of women are the way men see them and not the way women see themselves; why all women in modern society are expected to have children and be the primary caretaker; why domestic work is almost always the sole responsibility of wives, even when they earn more than half the family income; why there are so few women in positions of authority, when women can be found in substantial numbers in many occupations and professions; and why women have not benefitted from major social revolutions. Lorber argues that the whole point of the gender system today is to maintain structured gender inequality - to produce a subordinate class (women) that can be exploited as workers, sexual partners, childbearers, and emotional nurturers. Calling into question the inevitability and necessity of gender,she envisions a society structured for equality, where no gender, racial ethnic, or social class group is allowed to monopolize economic, educational, and cultural resources or the positions of power.},

Local opposition to large carnivores is a frequent source of conflict and a major obstacle for large carnivore conservation worldwide. The aim of our study is to understand hunters' reasons for opposing large carnivores, paying particular attention to the social dimension of the conflict. In an area where a vigorous conflict about lynx (Lynx lynx) exists without there actually being individuals of this species resident, we conducted group discussions with hunters, a group that includes many lynx opponents. Results were interpreted using the theories of social identity and psychological reactance. We found that, despite the absence of large carnivores, hunters' perceptions and reasoning resembled those present in areas with resident large carnivores. This underlines the significance of the social dimension. Results show that the hunters' position in the lynx conflict is shaped by past experiences with pro-lynx groups (forestry and nature conservation). In this interaction, hunters see their social identity as being threatened which in turn leads to group discrimination and reactance processes \textendash{} the latter possibly resulting in illegal shootings of lynx. Thus, hunters' opposition is not solely about the impacts of the lynx, but also about defending their social identity and withstanding impairment of their perceived freedoms by other interest groups. We argue that actively dealing with such group dynamics could serve as a missing link between large carnivore protection and conflict management. Future large carnivore management should focus more on shaping the quality of the interaction between the managers, advocates and opponents of large carnivores in order to overcome group-conflict and reactance processes. Large carnivores are legally protected in Europe (Berne Convention (Council of Europe 1979), Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC)), but local opposition to large carnivores often challenges the success of conservation efforts (Kaltenborn and Bjerke 2002, Molinari-Jobin et al. 2010, Majic et al. 2011). This leads to conflicts about the carnivores and their management. A common view amongst researchers as well as practitioners in this field is that under-standing the source of the opposition will help manage the conflicts and thereby promote large carnivore conservation (Ericsson and Heberlein 2003, Kleiven et al. 2004, Majic et al. 2011, Glikman et al. 2012). Given that in many Euro-pean regions illegal shootings threaten the survival of large carnivore populations (Andr\'en et al. 2006, \v{C}erven\'y et al. 2002, von Arx et al. 2004, Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-W\"ursten 2008), understanding hunters' perceptions of large carnivores seems especially relevant. Current research on what forms attitudes towards large carnivores includes many quantitative studies that focus on demographic factors, normative beliefs or value orientations (Bath 1989, Bjerke et al. 1998, Hunziker et al. 2001, Williams et al. 2002, Naughton-Treves et al. 2003, Kleiven et al. 2004, Glikman et al. 2010, 2012, Teel and Manfredo 2010, Majic et al. 2011, Herrmann et al. 2013).

  abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated a sexual dimorphism of the human corpus callosum. However, the question remains if sex differences in brain size, which typically is larger in men than in women, or biological sex per se account for the apparent sex differences in callosal morphology. Comparing callosal dimensions between men and women matched for overall brain size may clarify the true contribution of biological sex, as any observed group difference should indicate pure sex effects. We thus examined callosal morphology in 24 male and 24 female brains carefully matched for overall size. In addition, we selected 24 extremely large male brains and 24 extremely small female brains to explore if observed sex effects might vary depending on the degree to which male and female groups differed in brain size. Using the individual T1-weighted brain images (n. = 96), we delineated the corpus callosum at midline and applied a well-validated surface-based mesh-modeling approach to compare callosal thickness at 100 equidistant points between groups determined by brain size and sex. The corpus callosum was always thicker in men than in women. However, this callosal sex difference was strongly determined by the cerebral sex difference overall. That is, the larger the discrepancy in brain size between men and women, the more pronounced the sex difference in callosal thickness, with hardly any callosal differences remaining between brain-size matched men and women. Altogether, these findings suggest that individual differences in brain size account for apparent sex differences in the anatomy of the corpus callosum. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

A total of 269 individuals collected between 1992 and 1995 was typed for seven microsatellite loci. A modified version of the classical multiple correspondence analysis is carried out. This analysis clearly shows the dichotomy between the two races. Several approaches are used to study genetic structuring. Gene flow is clearly reduced between these chromosome races and is estimated at one migrant every two generations using R-statistics and one migrant per generation using F-statistics. Hierarchical F- and R-statistics are compared and their efficiency to detect inter- and intraracial patterns of divergence is discussed. Within-race genetic structuring is significant, but remains weak. FST displays similar values on both sides of the hybrid zone, although no environmental barriers are found on the Cordon side, whereas the Valais side is divided by several mountain rivers. We introduce the exact G-test to microsatellite data which proved to be a powerful test to detect genetic differentiation within as well as among races. The genetic background of karyotypic hybrids was compared with the genetic background of pure parental forms using a CRT\textendash MCA. Our results indicate that, without knowledge of the karyotypes, we would not have been able to distinguish these hybrids from karyotypically pure samples.},

To what extent would perceptual and cognitive constraints similarly affect the evolution of musical systems? We conducted an experiment on the cultural evolution of artificial melodic systems, using multi-generational signaling games as a laboratory model of cultural transmission. Signaling systems, using five-tone sequences as signals, and basic and compound emotions as meanings, were transmitted from senders to receivers along diffusion chains in which the receiver in each game became the sender in the next game. During transmission, structural regularities accumulated in the signaling systems, following principles of proximity, symmetry, and good continuation. Although the compositionality of signaling systems did not increase significantly across generations, we did observe a significant increase in similarity among signals from the same set. We suggest that our experiment tapped into the cognitive and perceptual constraints operative in the cultural evolution of musical systems, which may differ from the mechanisms at play in language evolution and change.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the biological and cultural evolution of music, and specifically in the role played by perceptual and cognitive factors in shaping core features of musical systems, such as melody, harmony, and rhythm. One proposal originates in the language sciences. It holds that aspects of musical systems evolve by adapting gradually, in the course of successive generations, to the structural and functional characteristics of the sensory and memory systems of learners and `users' of music. This hypothesis has found initial support in laboratory experiments on music transmission. In this article, we first review some of the most important theoretical and empirical contributions to the field of music evolution. Next, we identify a major current limitation of these studies, i.e., the lack of direct neural support for the hypothesis of cognitive adaptation. Finally, we discuss a recent experiment in which this issue was addressed by using event-related potentials (ERPs). We suggest that the introduction of neurophysiology in cultural transmission research may provide novel insights on the micro-evolutionary origins of forms of variation observed in cultural systems.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to examine the mnemonic effects of music on lyric recall, and to determine the role of musical expertise in the degree of memory benefit from information presented in a song. The experiment used a mixed-factor design to compare recall performance in music and nonmusic presentations, in addition to comparing performance of musicians and nonmusicians. Participants were presented with a set of lyrics in one of two encoding conditions: music (delivered as part of a song) or nonmusic (read aloud without music), followed by a free recall test. This process repeated 3 times, with a distractor task before the third recall test. One week later, participants were given an identical series of encoding and recall tasks in the other encoding condition, followed by a recall test for lyrics presented in the first session. Results showed significantly higher recall in the music condition during Session 1 as measured by words (verbatim), lines (gist), and clusters (chunking), ps {$<$} .05; for delayed recall, there was a music advantage as measured by words and clusters, ps {$<$} .05. Musicians showed significantly higher 1-week-delayed word and line recall, regardless of encoding condition, ps {$<$} .05. Several significant differences were found in relation to task load, suggesting that music-based learning may affect subjective experience, specifically task success and time pressure; further, musicians reported lower mental activity required when learning through music. Further applications of the study are discussed in an educational context. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We tested brevity for short-range social and distress sounds from four echolocating bats: adult black-bearded tomb bat Taphozous melanopogon, Mexican free-tailed bat Tadarida brasiliensis, adult greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, and adult least horseshoe bat Rhinolophus pusillus. There was a negative association between duration and number of social but not distress calls emitted. The most frequently emitted social calls were brief, while most distress calls were long. Brevity or lengthiness was consistently selected in vocal communications for each species. Echolocating bats seem to have convergent coding strategy for communication calls. The results provide the evidence of efficient coding in bat social vocalizations, and lay the basis of future researches on the convergence for neural control on bats' communication calls.},

  abstract = {Background: Languages differ greatly both in their syntactic and morphological systems and in the social environments in which they exist. We challenge the view that language grammars are unrelated to social environments in which they are learned and used. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a statistical analysis of {$>$}2,000 languages using a combination of demographic sources and the World Atlas of Language Structures- a database of structural language properties. We found strong relationships between linguistic factors related to morphological complexity, and demographic/socio-historical factors such as the number of language users, geographic spread, and degree of language contact. The analyses suggest that languages spoken by large groups have simpler inflectional morphology than languages spoken by smaller groups as measured on a variety of factors such as case systems and complexity of conjugations. Additionally, languages spoken by large groups are much more likely to use lexical strategies in place of inflectional morphology to encode evidentiality, negation, aspect, and possession. Our findings indicate that just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. As adults learn a language, features that are difficult for them to acquire, are less likely to be passed on to subsequent learners. Languages used for communication in large groups that include adult learners appear to have been subjected to such selection. Conversely, the morphological complexity common to languages used in small groups increases redundancy which may facilitate language learning by infants. Conclusions/Significance: We hypothesize that language structures are subjected to different evolutionary pressures in different social environments. Just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. The proposed Linguistic Niche Hypothesis has implications for answering the broad question of why languages differ in the way they do and makes empirical predictions regarding language acquisition capacities of children versus adults. \textcopyright{} 2010 Lupyan, Dale.},

Differing viewpoints on whether and how humans can share landscapes with large carnivores can influence conservation policies. To characterize current viewpoints about terrestrial large carnivore conservation, we conducted an online survey assessing a wide range of viewpoints about large carnivore conservation among international professionals (n = 505). We explored how variation in viewpoints was related to expertise, background, and broader institutional contexts in which one lives and works. The majority of participants agreed people and large carnivores can share the same landscapes (86\%). Human adaptation to carnivores (95\% agreement) and acceptance of some conflict (93\%) were the highest ranked requirements for human-carnivore coexistence. We found broad consensus regarding intrinsic value of carnivores, reasons carnivores are imperilled, conflict drivers, and importance of proactive solutions, such as adopting preventative livestock husbandry methods or avoiding situations that put people at risk. The greatest polarization was observed in issues related to lethal control, where we only found broad consensus for killing carnivores in situations where humans are in immediate risk. Participants opposed the killing of large carnivores when objectives were to decrease population sizes or increase human tolerance, profits, livelihoods, or fear of humans. Results point to considerable diversity, perhaps driven by local context, concerning how to proceed with large carnivore conservation in the increasingly human-influenced landscapes of the Anthropocene. The different observed viewpoints represent both different strategies about how to best conserve, but also different moral platforms about what, how, where, and for whom conservation should occur. Our study underlines that challenges to adopting and implementing long-lasting carnivore conservation strategies may well occur as much within the conservation community as outside it.},

Population geneticists always first assume a neutral pattern of variation for molecular data, and only look to non-neutral (e.g., selective) scenarios for pattern and variation in the face of strong evidence against this null model of neutral expectation. Here, using a combination of cultural transmission theory, morphometrics, and the principles of population genetics, (null) neutral expectations for Acheulean handaxe symmetry are tested. The results of the analyses are inconsistent with a null hypothesis of neutral expectation for patterns of handaxe symmetry variation. Rather, the results imply that the property of symmetry in Acheulean handaxes was subject to selection for functional, adaptive or social reasons.},

The scores of the two groups of apes that were reared in a sociolinguistically complex environment were significantly higher than the scores of the standard-reared group.

Most studies of adaptive maternal effects are a "snapshot" of a mother's lifetime offspring provisioning and do not generally consider the effects of earlier siblings on those produced later. Here we show that in soil mites, offspring provisioning strategies are dynamic, changing from an emphasis on egg number in young females to egg size in older females. This pattern may be adaptive if it increases the survival of younger offspring that must compete with older, larger siblings. The dynamic shift in egg provisioning was greater in high-food environments in which females lived longer, creating increasing asymmetry in offspring competitive abilities. Females reared in isolation and in the presence of a high-density colony had identical provisioning strategies, suggesting that, unlike males in this species, females do not use pheromones to assess colony size. Our findings suggest that the adaptive significance of maternal effects may be misinterpreted when studies consider only a snapshot of a female's offspring provisioning strategy or when components of the offspring provisioning strategy are studied in isolation.}

  abstract = {How did human vocalizations come to acquire meaning in the evolution of our species? Charles Darwin proposed that language and music originated from a common emotional signal system based on the imitation and modification of sounds in nature. This {$<$}em{$>$}protolanguage{$<$}/em{$>$} is thought to have diverged into two separate systems, with speech prioritizing {$<$}em{$>$}referential{$<$}/em{$>$} functionality and music prioritizing {$<$}em{$>$}emotional{$<$}/em{$>$} functionality. However, there has never been an attempt to empirically evaluate the hypothesis that a single communication system can split into two functionally distinct systems that are characterized by music- and languagelike properties. Here, we demonstrate that when referential and emotional functions are introduced into an artificial communication system, that system will diverge into vocalization forms with speech- and music-like properties, respectively. Participants heard novel vocalizations as part of a learning task. Half referred to physical entities and half functioned to communicate emotional states. Participants then reproduced each sound with the defined communicative intention in mind. Each recorded vocalization was used as the input for another participant in a serial reproduction paradigm, and this procedure was iterated to create 15 chains of five participants each. Referential vocalizations were rated as more {$<$}em{$>$}speech-like{$<$}/em{$>$}, whereas emotional vocalizations were rated as more {$<$}em{$>$}music-like{$<$}/em{$>$}, and this association was observed cross-culturally. In addition, a stable separation of the acoustic profiles of referential and emotional vocalizations emerged, with some attributes diverging immediately and others diverging gradually across iterations. The findings align with Darwin's hypothesis and provide insight into the roles of biological and cultural evolution in the divergence of language and music.}

In multiple members of the well-studied KE family, a heterozygous missense mutation in FOXP2 causes problems in sequencing muscle movements required for articulating speech (developmental verbal dyspraxia), accompanied by wider deficits in linguistic and grammatical processing. Chromosomal rearrangements involving this locus have also been identified. Analyses of FOXP2 coding sequence in typical forms of specific language impairment (SLI), autism, and dyslexia have not uncovered any etiological variants. However, no previous study has performed mutation screening of children with a primary diagnosis of verbal dyspraxia, the most overt feature of the disorder in affected members of the KE family. Here, we report investigations of the entire coding region of FOXP2, including alternatively spliced exons, in 49 probands affected with verbal dyspraxia. We detected variants that alter FOXP2 protein sequence in three probands. One such variant is a heterozygous nonsense mutation that yields a dramatically truncated protein product and cosegregates with speech and language difficulties in the proband, his affected sibling, and their mother. Our discovery of the first nonsense mutation in FOXP2 now opens the door for detailed investigations of neurodevelopment in people carrying different etiological variants of the gene. This endeavor will be crucial for gaining insight into the role of FOXP2 in human cognition.},

We examined the effect of food restriction on song-control brain regions in fledgling (both sexes, 23-26 days old) song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). Food restriction selectively reduced HVC volume in both sexes. In addition, sex differences were evident in all three song-control regions.

To address this, we compared microsatellite allele frequencies from 18 sample sites representing eight dialect regions in the Sierra Nevada. Pairwise genetic distances were not significantly correlated with geographic distances either within or between dialects, nor did dialect groups form distinct genetic groups according to neighbor-joining or UPGMA analysis, and most variation in allele frequencies occurred among individuals rather than at higher levels. However, most of the remaining variation was attributable to differences among, rather than within, dialect regions, and this among-dialect component of variance was statistically significant. Moreover, when controlling for the effect of geographic distance, song dissimilarity and genetic distance between site pairs were significantly correlated. Thus, song dialects appear to be associated with reductions in, but not strict barriers to, gene flow among dialect regions. Corresponding Editor: P.

In the case of the dawn chorus in the great tit Parus major none of these assumptions apply. A peak of song at dawn only appears in late spring when territorial boundaries are established and birds are paired6,7. Conflict between singing and foraging cannot explain why males with more non-foraging time in longer days at northern latitudes roost earlier than birds at southern latitudes and still sing before dawn8. Female emergence from her nest hole terminates the dawn chorus in the great tit9.

  abstract = {Human and nonhuman primates rely almost exclusively on vision for social communication. Therefore, tracking eye movements and examining visual scan paths can provide a wealth of information about many aspects of primate social information processing. Although eye-tracking techniques have been utilized with humans for some time, similar studies in nonhuman primates have been less frequent over recent decades. This has largely been owing to the need for invasive manipulations, such as the surgical implantation of devices to limit head movement, which may not be possible in some laboratories or at some universities, or may not be congruent with some experimental aims (i.e., longitudinal studies). It is important for all nonhuman primate researchers interested in visual information processing or operant behavior to realize that such invasive procedures are no longer necessary. Here, we briefly describe new methods for fully noninvasive video eye-tracking with adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We also describe training protocols that require only {$\sim$}30 days to accomplish and quality control measures that promote reliable data collection. It is our hope that this brief overview will reacquaint nonhuman primate researchers with the benefits of eye-tracking and promote expanded use of this powerful methodology.},

Hippocampal volume correlated with the amount of time spent as a taxi driver (positively in the posterior and negatively in the anterior hippocampus).

First, do people automatically evaluate symmetry without explicit instruction? Second, is perfect symmetry the best stimulus, or do people prefer a degree of imperfection? Third, does initial preference for symmetry diminish after familiarity sets in? Stimuli were generated as phenotypes from an algorithmic genotype, with genes for symmetry (coded as deviation from a symmetrical template, deviation-symmetry, DS gene) and orientation (0\textordmasculine{} to 90\textordmasculine, orientation, ORI gene). An eye tracker identified phenotypes that were good at attracting and retaining the gaze of the observer. Resulting fitness scores determined the genotypes that passed to the next generation. We recoreded changes to the distribution of DS and ORI over 20 generations. When participants looked for symmetry, there was an increase in high-symmetry genes. When participants looked for the patterns they preferred, there was a smaller increase in symmetry, indicating that people tolerated some imperfection. Conversely, there was no increase in symmetry during free viewing, and no effect of familiarity or orientation. This work demonstrates the viability of the evolutionary algorithm approach as a quantitative measure of aesthetic preference.},

  abstract = {Orientation processing in visual cortex appears matched to the environment, such that larger neural populations are tuned to cardinal (horizontal/vertical) than oblique orientations. This may be manifested perceptually as a cardinal bias: poorer sensitivity to oblique compared to cardinal orientations (the "oblique effect"). However, a growing body of psychophysical data reveals the opposite pattern of anisotropy: a bias towards the oblique over the cardinal orientations (the "horizontal effect"), something matched by recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that have found an increased response to the oblique over the cardinal orientations in early visual cortex. This may reveal the operation of an efficient coding strategy optimised to the diet of orientations encountered during natural viewing. From consideration of coding efficiency, it might be expected that the anisotropies would change as the quality/strength of the oriented stimulus changes. In two experiments, fMRI response modulations were measured in retinotopically-defined human early visual cortex as a function of the contrast and orientation of sinusoidal gratings. Both experiments revealed a marked change in the V1 response from a cardinal (vertical) bias at low contrast to an oblique bias at high contrast. In Experiment 2, this was also apparent in areas V2 and V3. On average, there was no systematic "radial bias" (a preference for orientations aligned with the visual field meridian) in V1, although it was present in some individual subjects. The change in orientation anisotropies with contrast is consistent with an adaptive stimulus coding strategy in cortex that shifts according to the strength of the sensory inputs.},

Global genetic analyses have argued for one single origin, placed somewhere in Africa. This scenario implies a rapid expansion, with a series of bottlenecks of small amplitude, which would have led to the observed smooth loss of genetic diversity with increasing distance from Africa. Analyses of cranial data, on the other hand, have given mixed results, and have been argued to support multiple origins of modern humans. Using a large data set of skull measurements and an analytical framework equivalent to that used for genetic data, we show that the loss in genetic diversity has been mirrored by a loss in phenotypic variability. We find evidence for an African origin, placed somewhere in the central/southern part of the continent, which harbours the highest intra-population diversity in phenotypic measurements. We failed to find evidence for a second origin, and we confirm these results on a large genetic data set. Distance from Africa accounts for an average 19-25\% of heritable variation in craniometric measurements-a remarkably strong effect for phenotypic measurements known to be under selection.},

These differences raise many questions regarding how such divergent phenotypes can arise from a genome that is largely shared between the sexes. Recent progress in genomics has revealed some of the actual genetic mechanisms that create separate sex-specific phenotypes, and the evidence indicates that thousands of genes across all portions of the genome contribute to male and female forms through sex-biased gene expression. Related work has begun to define the strength and influence of sex-specific evolutionary forces that shape these phenotypic dimorphisms and how they in turn affect the genome. Additionally, theory has long suggested that the evolution of sexual dimorphism is facilitated by sex chromosomes, as these are the only portions of the genome that differ between males and females. Genomic analysis indicates that there is indeed a relationship between sexual dimorphism and the sex chromosomes. However, the connection is far more complicated than current theory allows, and this may ultimately require a reexamination of the assumptions so that predictions match the accumulating empirical data.},

  abstract = {The problem of identifying subtle time-space clustering of disease, as may be occurring in leukemia, is described and reviewed. Published approaches, generally associated with studies of leukemia, not dependent on knowledge of the underlying population for their validity, are directed towards identifying clustering by establishing a relationship between the temporal and the spatial separations for the n ( n - 1)/2 possible pairs which can be formed from the n observed cases of disease. Here it is proposed that statistical power can be improved by applying a reciprocal transform to these separations. While a permutational approach can give valid probability levels for any observed association, for reasons of practicability, it is suggested that the observed association be tested relative to its permutational variance. Formulas and computational procedures for doing so are given. While the distance measures between points represent symmetric relationships subject to mathematical and geometric regularities, the variance formula developed is appropriate for arbitrary relationships. Simplified procedures are given for the case of symmetric and skew-symmetric relationships. The general procedure is indicated as being potentially useful in other situations as, for example, the study of interpersonal relationships. Viewing the procedure as a regression approach, the possibility for extending it to nonlinear and multivariate situations is suggested. Other aspects of the problem and of the procedure developed are discussed. Similarly, pure temporal clustering can be identified by a study of incidence rates in periods of widespread epidemics. In point of fact, many epidemics of communicable diseases are somewhat local in nature and so these do actually constitute temporal-spatial clusters. For leukemia and similar diseases in which cases seem to arise substantially at random rather than as clear-cut epidemics, it is necessary to devise sensitive and efficient procedures for detecting any nonrandom component of disease occurrence. Various ingenious procedures which statisticians have developed for the detection of disease clustering are reviewed here. These procedures can be generalized so as to increase their statistical validity and efficiency. The technic to be given below for imparting statistical validity to the procedures already in vogue can be viewed as a generalized form of regression with possible useful application to problems arising in quite different contexts.},

  abstract = {Since 1945, the Western world has recorded a sharp increase in Marian apparitions and messages, which in terms of frequency, content, structure and representation differ from those of previous centuries. The often oppositional content is actively disseminated by traditionalist and fundamentalist Catholics and devotees, and generates cults and shrines which turn away from or disassociate themselves from the Catholic Church. On the basis of two related and much discussed cases, Amsterdam's cultus of The Lady of All Nations and the devotion to the Queen of Peace at Medjugorje, this paper investigates the manner in which these two Marian interventions are articulated and interpreted by the visionaries, and how these interventions relate to the ideological wars which have dominated ecclesiastical politics, and the politics of the Christian world, since the Second World War. When the Roman Catholic Church fails to get such processes of religious divergence under control, it appears that because of the success of some of these cults the ecclesiastical hierarchy ultimately finds itself forced, willingly or not, to join in or converge with the heterodox and previously rejected opinions. In this way the Church increases the significance of conservative and traditionalist thought and practice within its faith community.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Scale and tempo of brain expansion in the course of human evolution implies that this process was driven by a positive feedback. The "cultural drive" hypothesis suggests a possible mechanism for the runaway brain-culture coevolution wherein high-fidelity social learning results in accumulation of cultural traditions which, in turn, promote selection for still more efficient social learning. Here we explore this evolutionary mechanism by means of computer modeling. Simulations confirm its plausibility in a social species in a socio-ecological situation that makes the sporadic invention of new beneficial and cognitively demanding behaviors possible. The chances for the runaway brain-culture coevolution increase when some of the culturally transmitted behaviors are individually beneficial while the others are group-beneficial. In this case, "cultural drive" is possible under varying levels of between-group competition and migration. Modeling implies that brain expansion can receive additional boost if the evolving mechanisms of social learning are costly in terms of brain expansion (e.g., rely on complex neuronal circuits) and tolerant to the complexity of information transferred, that is, make it possible to transfer complex skills and concepts easily. Human language presumably fits this description. Modeling also confirms that the runaway brain-culture coevolution can be accelerated by additional positive feedback loops via population growth and life span extension, and that between-group competition and cultural group selection can facilitate the propagation of group-beneficial behaviors and remove maladaptive cultural traditions from the population's culture, which individual selection is unable to do.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

France, the Thames Valley, N. Lancashire and the Scottish Highlands\textemdash are distinguished on the number and arrangement of note sequences, in the trill, and of notes, in the phrase. 3 Fourteen distinct types of trill were discovered and forty-five types of phrase. 4 It is shown that both the trill and, more particularly, the phrase are highly variable even within one locality. 5 The numbers of possible phrase types which might be recorded by this method are calculated, and it is shown that most of these up to three notes have been discovered, that further investigation will quickly reveal more 4-note and 5-note types, but that the discovery of 6-note and 7-note types will be slow because of their comparative rarity. 6 It emerges that some song types are much more common than others. Trills of two or three sequences of descending pitch make up 83 per cent of the results and none of the other twelve types exceeds 3 per cent of the total. 7 In the phrase from 0 to 7 notes may be used, but those with 3\textendash 5 notes are most frequent. There is evidence for a preference for certain patterns within each number-class. 8 It is shown statistically that geographical variation of song between the separate regions occurs and that the songs characteristic of any one area can only be described in statistical terms. The suggested existence of song types confined and exclusive to a particular region cannot be substantiated, although this condition is approached in one case. 9 From a comparison with data from Russia, it appears that the trills are similar to the Western European forms, but that the range of notes in the phrase is lower and that the mean number of notes per phrase is lower\textemdash 1.99 as compared with 2.91. 10 The song variants are distributed as dialects, and it is shown that the formation of these can be understood in the light of work on song inheritance. 11 It is inferred from its phenotypic nature that the geographical variation of the Chaffinch song cannot still be regarded as an example of incipient speciation.},

  abstract = {The phenomenon of "dialect" variation in bird song, appearing as a consisteent difference in the dredominant song type between one population and another of the same species, has a special interest for biologists, serving as a focus for attention in discussion of such diverse topics as speciation, learning and the mechanisms of social communacation. The White-crowned Sparrow affords one of the best known cases of such "dilect" variation among North American birds, and it has been commented upon by many who have observed this species. Before the ontogenetic basis of such local song variation can be assessed and before its evolutionary significance can be satisfactorily determined, careful descriptions of the nature and extent of the variation are required. This paper seeks to provide some of this neccessary information by describing song variation in the individual and in a population, both at one time and from year to year, and also by comparing songs in three populations, two adjacent and one distant.},

Male swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana, trained with tape-recorded songs in infancy, developed song some 8 months later, averaging 2.2 song types per bird. Analysis of the intermediate stage of plastic song revealed that the birds generated 4 to 5 times more song material than was needed for the species-specific song repertoire. The excess was discarded at the time of full song crystallization. Indications that the attrition process is selective include tendencies to retain imitated rather than nonimitated elements, and the rejection of heterospecific elements. Attrition may also be influenced by vocal stimulation at the time of song crystallization, providing an opportunity for behavioral adjustment even though new themes can no longer be learned. Attrition has been described in the transition in human infants from babbling to speech.},

  abstract = {A swamp sparrow song is a 2-s string of about 10 identical syllables, each made up of two to five distinct notes. Naturally-occurring syllables are highly polymorphic. The development of syllable patterning is strongly influenced by imitation. Analysis of 452 songs indicates that, whether simple or complex, all syllables were assembled from the same species-universal set of note types, consisting of six basic categories. Two populations studied intensively, 1000 km apart, differed in the number of notes per syllable and the ordering of note types within a syllable. It appears that song dialects can be defined in the swamp sparrow by reference to these features. The process of song learning in the swamp sparrow thus consists of the selection of a particular number, timing and sequence of notes from a limited set of types. While some degree of selection of within-type note variants is possible, the structure of the major categories of swamp sparrow note types is in large degree genetically preordained.},

  abstract = {We consider kernel estimation of a univariate density whose support is a compact interval. If the density is non-zero at either boundary, then the usual kernel estimator can be seriously biased. `Reflection' at a boundary removes some bias, but unless the first derivative of the density is 0 at the boundary the estimator with reflection can still be much more severely biased at the boundary than in the interior. We propose to transform the data to a density that has its first derivative equal to 0 at both boundaries. The density of the transformed data is estimated, and an estimate of the density of the original data is obtained by a change of variables. The transformation is selected from a parametric family, which is allowed to be quite general in our theoretical study. We propose algorithms where the transformation is either a quartic polynomial, a \&\#x3b2; cumulative density function (CDF) or a linear combination of a polynomial and a \&\#x3b2; CDF. The last two types of transformation are designed to accommodate possible poles at the boundaries. The first two algorithms are tested on simulated data and compared with an adjusted kernel method of Rice. We find that our proposal performs similarly to Rice's for densities with one-sided derivatives at the boundaries. Unlike Rice's method, our proposal is guaranteed to produce non-negative estimates. This can be a distinct advantage when the density is 0 at either boundary. Our algorithm for densities with poles outperforms the Rice adjustment when the density has a pole at a boundary.}

The iconography has been found to be different from that in contemporaneous symbol systems in the Western European Upper Paleolithic, but the basic modes and strategies of symbol use were nevertheless comparable or similar. The data raise a number of profound questions concerning (a) the origin or origins of early Homo sapiens sapiens symbol usage and the possible early dispersal or diffusion of certain cognitive and cultural modes of symbol use, (b) the possible near-iconic nature of the earliest H. sapiens sapiens symbol systems, and (c) the relevance of these evolving systems for those symbolic traditions that persisted and developed in the post-Wurm. It seems that at least some of these systems in the Eastern and Western Upper Paleolithic were aspects of a water-related symbolism and therefore referred to a phenomenological reality as valid and persistent as the realities referred to in Upper Paleolithic images of animals and females.},

While many terabytes of data are collected annually, effective use of this noisy, highly variable data require skilled humans to manually identify calls. While computer programs to automatically analyse these recordings are becoming available, it is important that they are user-friendly and easy-to-use, so that everybody \textendash{} citizen scientists, wildlife managers, researchers \textendash{} can take advantage of them, and that they keep the human in the loop so analyses carried out this year are comparable both to manual call counts from the past, and more accurate automated analyses performed in the future. We present the AviaNZ program, which is designed to achieve these goals: the software includes methods for simple, rapid manual annotation of recordings, denoising and segmentation methods, and a training procedure by which the user can prepare their own filters to automatically recognize individual species. The software can run in batch mode, automatically processing folders of field recordings, and then present the outputs to enable the quick and easy review of the results. Finally, the outputs are presented in a variety of spreadsheets to enable different statistical analyses to be performed. We describe the various workflows of manually and semi-automatically processing sound files, annotating them to train automatic filters, using those filters in batch mode, and how the software facilitates rapid evaluation of the automated analysis. A demonstration of the software, comparing manual and automatic detection of calls of the little spotted kiwi Apteryx owenii is given. It shows that while the automatic detection does produce false positives, human correction of these is far faster than manual review of the whole sound file. AviaNZ is a freely available open-source standalone program. Our experience shows that it can be used by anybody quickly and easily. However, for experienced users it is easily customizable and extendable. By enabling everybody involved with acoustic bird recording to quickly and easily analyse their own data, while future-proofing it by keeping the human in the loop, we are enabling acoustic field recordings to meet their potential.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Rosuvastatin is one of the most potent statins and is currently widely prescribed. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of rosuvastatin on blood lipids. OBJECTIVES Primary objective To quantify the effects of various doses of rosuvastatin on serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides in participants with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease. Secondary objectives To quantify the variability of the effect of various doses of rosuvastatin.To quantify withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in the randomized placebo-controlled trials. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 10 of 12, 2014 in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1946 to October week 5 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 week 44), Web of Science Core Collection (1970 to 5 November 2014) and BIOSIS Citation Index (1969 to 31 October 2014). No language restrictions were applied. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of rosuvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data. WDAEs information was collected from the placebo-controlled trials. MAIN RESULTS One-hundred and eight trials (18 placebo-controlled and 90 before-and-after) evaluated the dose-related efficacy of rosuvastatin in 19,596 participants. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg/day caused LDL-cholesterol decreases of 46\% to 55\%, when all the trials were combined using the generic inverse variance method. The quality of evidence for these effects is high. Log dose-response data over doses of 1 to 80 mg, revealed strong linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol. When compared to atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was about three-fold more potent at reducing LDL-cholesterol. There was no dose-related effect of rosuvastatin on blood HDL-cholesterol, but overall, rosuvastatin increased HDL by 7\%. There is a high risk of bias for the trials in this review, which would affect WDAEs, but unlikely to affect the lipid measurements. WDAEs were not statistically different between rosuvastatin and placebo in 10 of 18 of these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.84; 95\% confidence interval 0.48 to 1.47). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The total blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol-lowering effect of rosuvastatin was linearly dependent on dose. Rosuvastatin log dose-response data were linear over the commonly prescribed dose range. Based on an informal comparison with atorvastatin, this represents a three-fold greater potency. This review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with rosuvastatin because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in 44\% of the placebo-controlled trials.},

We leverage the ability of the transformer-based BERT model to generate contextualised embeddings capable of detecting semantic change of words across time. Several approaches are compared in a common setting in order to establish strengths and weaknesses for each of them. We also propose several ideas for improvements, managing to drastically improve the performance of existing approaches.}

The efficacy of acoustic signals can depend on many factors, including the transmitter, the receiver, and the signalling environment. In the present study, we evaluate the effect of body size and habitat on the evolution of learned vocal displays across the tanagers (Aves: Thraupidae), a group that comprises nearly 10\% of all songbird species. We find that body size affects tanager vocalizations, such that nine out of ten song characters and scores from two principal component axes were correlated with mass. More specifically, larger tanagers tended to produce slower-paced, lower-pitched vocal displays within narrower bandwidths. In contrast, habitat was correlated with only three out of ten song characters, and only one of these characters corroborated the directional predictions of the acoustic adaptation hypothesis. Thus, morphological characters, such as body mass, may play a more important role than variation among signalling environments in the evolution of avian vocal displays. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Linnean Society of London.},

  abstract = {Highly social animals possess a well-developed ability to distinguish the faces of familiar from novel conspecifics to induce distinct behaviors for maintaining society. However, the behaviors of animals when they encounter ambiguous faces of familiar yet novel conspecifics, e.g., strangers with faces resembling known individuals, have not been well characterised. Using a morphing technique and preferential-looking paradigm, we address this question via the chimpanzee's facial\textendash recognition abilities. We presented eight subjects with three types of stimuli: (1) familiar faces, (2) novel faces and (3) intermediate morphed faces that were 50\% familiar and 50\% novel faces of conspecifics. We found that chimpanzees spent more time looking at novel faces and scanned novel faces more extensively than familiar or intermediate faces. Interestingly, chimpanzees looked at intermediate faces in a manner similar to familiar faces with regards to the fixation duration, fixation count, and saccade length for facial scanning, even though the participant was encountering the intermediate faces for the first time. We excluded the possibility that subjects merely detected and avoided traces of morphing in the intermediate faces. These findings suggest a bias for a feeling-of-familiarity that chimpanzees perceive familiarity with an intermediate face by detecting traces of a known individual, as 50\% alternation is sufficient to perceive familiarity.},

Here we report an analysis comparing cultural and genetic data from 13 populations from in and around Northeast Asia spanning 10 different language families/isolates. We construct distance matrices for language (grammar, phonology, lexicon), music (song structure, performance style), and genomes (genome-wide SNPs) and test for correlations among them. After controlling for spatial autocorrelation and recent contact, robust correlations emerge between genetic and grammatical distances. Our results suggest that grammatical structure might be one of the strongest cultural indicators of human population history, while also demonstrating differences among cultural and genetic relationships that highlight the complex nature of human cultural and genetic evolution.},

One type involved masking by noise, in which the visibility of the geometric pattern target was tested with a spatially overlapping noise as the mask stimulus. The other type involved paracontrast and metacontrast masking, in which the mask stimuli flanked but did not spatially overlap the target stimuli. Temporal characteristics regarding the visibility of target stimuli, displayed as functions of temporal asynchrony between target and mask stimuli, differed with the mask type in chimpanzees as in humans. Peak deterioration in visibility occurred at the point of minimum temporal asynchrony both in forward and backward masking by noise, but was not at 0 ms temporal asynchrony when the target and mask stimuli did not spatially overlap. These results suggest that chimpanzees and humans share the underlying mechanisms in two kinds of temporal inhibition caused by spatially overlapping and non-overlapping mask stimuli.},

The focus in this section is on the relationship between marian apparitions Christian culture and fin-de-si\`ecle apocalypticism. In the second section a closer consideration is given to the phenomenon of `miraculous photography' in this evolving tradition of piety, a tradition of divination by images. The third part of the essay addresses more fully the Vatican's response to this phenomenon in light of the personal Marian piety of Pope John Paul II, especially in view of the recent proclamation of the `Third Secret' of Fatima. The essay closes by suggesting some ways in which the tension between official Catholicism and largely `popular' twentiethcentury Marian apparitions can be revealing of the development of new forms of Christianity at the turn of the twenty-first century. \textcopyright{} 2001 Academic Press.}

  abstract = {Bayesian inference methods rely on numerical algorithms for both model selection and parameter inference. In general, these algorithms require a high computational effort to yield reliable estimates. One of the major challenges in phylogenetics is the estimation of the marginal likelihood. This quantity is commonly used for comparing different evolutionary models, but its calculation, even for simple models, incurs high computational cost. Another interesting challenge relates to the estimation of the posterior distribution. Often, long Markov chains are required to get sufficient samples to carry out parameter inference, especially for tree distributions. In general, these problems are addressed separately by using different procedures. Nested sampling (NS) is a Bayesian computation algorithm which provides the means to estimate marginal likelihoods together with their uncertainties, and to sample from the posterior distribution at no extra cost. The methods currently used in phylogenetics for marginal likelihood estimation lack in practicality due to their dependence on many tuning parameters and the inability of most implementations to provide a direct way to calculate the uncertainties associated with the estimates. To address these issues, we introduce NS to phylogenetics. Its performance is assessed under different scenarios and compared to established methods. We conclude that NS is a competitive and attractive algorithm for phylogenetic inference. An implementation is available as a package for BEAST 2 under the LGPL licence, accessible at https://github.com/BEAST2-Dev/nested-sampling.},

  abstract = {Developmental constraints (defined as biases on the production of variant phenotypes or limitations on phenotypic variability caused by the structure, character, composition, or dynamics of the developmental system) undoubtedly play a significant role in evolution. Yet there is little agreement on their importance as compared with selection, drift, and other such factors in shaping evolutionary history. This review distinguishes between "universal" and "local" constraints; it deals primarily with the latter, which apply to a limited range of taxa. Such constraints, typically, can be broken even within the taxa to which they apply, though with varying degrees of difficulty. The origin of constraints is discussed, five distinctive of constraint being explicitly considered. Three means of identifying constraints are set forth, as well as four means of distinguishing developmental from selective constraints. None of the latter (use of a priori adaptive predictions, direct measurement of selection, direct measurement of heritable variation, and use of the comparative method) is foolproof. In the final section, three larger issues regarding the role of developmental constraints in evolution are discussed: the extent to which evolutionary stasis can be explained in developmental terms, the extend to which evolutionary trends and patterns might be a consequence of developmental constraints, and the extent to which various genetic and developmental mechanisms have evolved in virtue of the need of lineages to manifest evolutionary plasticity (or adaptability) if they are to survive. Although no definitive conclusions are reached on these larger issues, we bring recent advances in developmental biology, evolutionary theory, and (to a limited extent) molecular biology to bear on them.},

  abstract = {The environment has a strong influence on a population's evolutionary dynamics. Driven by both intrinsic and external factors, the environment is subject to continual change in nature. To capture an ever-changing environment, we consider a model of evolutionary dynamics with game transitions, where individuals' behaviors together with the games that they play in one time step influence the games to be played in the next time step. Within this model, we study the evolution of cooperation in structured populations and find a simple rule: Weak selection favors cooperation over defection if the ratio of the benefit provided by an altruistic behavior, b, to the corresponding cost, c, exceeds {$<$}math{$>$}k-k{${'}<$}/math{$>$}, where k is the average number of neighbors of an individual and {$<$}math{$>$}k{${'}<$}/math{$>$} captures the effects of the game transitions. Even if cooperation cannot be favored in each individual game, allowing for a transition to a relatively valuable game after mutual cooperation and to a less valuable game after defection can result in a favorable outcome for cooperation. In particular, small variations in different games being played can promote cooperation markedly. Our results suggest that simple game transitions can serve as a mechanism for supporting prosocial behaviors in highly connected populations.}

  abstract = {In 2001 the Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of Sciences in the U.S.A, concluded that many aspects of both normal and pathological brain functioning exhibit important yet poorly understood sex differences (Wizemann and Pardu, 2001). Ten years later, the National Institute of Mental Health convened a workshop titled Sex Differences in Brain, Behavior, Mental Health and Mental Disorders and concluded (i) there is a paucity of research examining sex differences at a neurobiological and mechanistic level; (ii) there are pervasive sex differences in the brain, and, (iii) there is a need for more neuroscientists to incorporate sex as a variable in experimental designs (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/researchfunding/scientific-meetings/2011/sex-differences-in- brain-behavior-mental-health-and-mental-disorders/index.shtml). Several other government funding agencies in the United States and Europe have either explicitly or implicitly endorsed the study of the impact of sex and/or gender as important research goals to increase our understanding of normal brain development, adolescence, reproduction and aging, as well as pathologies in behavior involving socialization, ingestion, sleep and substance abuse. There are important sex differences in cognitive and emotional responses relevant to learning and memory, language, fear, anxiety and nociception, as well as the risk and consequences of traumatic brain injury, stroke, and the neurodegenerative diseases Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS and Huntington's. Neurological disorders such as dyslexia and stuttering are three to four times more frequent in boys than girls, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is diagnosed ten times more often in boys. In the arena of mental health, gender is also a potent predictor of the relative risk of developing autism or autism spectrum disorder, both of which are up to four times more prevalent in males, as is early onset schizophrenia with more severe symptoms reported in boys. Conversely, major depressive disorder, anxiety and panic disorders are almost two times as frequently diagnosed in women compared to men while anorexia bulimia is three times as prevalent and anorexia nervosa is a disturbing 13 times more frequent in women (Abel et al., 2010; Baron-Cohen et al., 2005; Cahill, 2006; De Vries and Simerly, 2002; Forger, 2009; Jazin and Cahill, 2010; McCarthy et al., 2009; McCarthy and Arnold, 2011; Morris et al., 2004; Simerly, 2002). A potentially informative difference in the pattern of gender bias in relative risk of mental illness is the preponderance of developmental onset disorders in males versus the higher frequency of adult onset disorders in females. Despite these profound differences, males remain the research subject of choice in neuroscience (Beery and Zucker, 2010). When we attempt to encourage our neuroscience friends and colleagues to consider the value of studying sex differences, we often hear ``after I understand the phenomenon in males, I'll check whether it's there in females'', or ``I would be interested in looking for sex differences but can't afford to double my N'', and lastly ``I would have to control for the phases of the estrous/menstrual cycle in females and that just seems too difficult and a waste of resources''. In our view, what most deters investigators from including females in their studies are misconceptions; misconceptions that it is difficult to do it right, and misconceptions of the value of comparing males and females, with many neuroscientists thinking they are not likely to learn anything useful, much less make novel discoveries. The purpose of this Tool Box article is to dispel those myths and provide simple guidelines for scientifically sound investigation of sex differences in the brain.},

Nevertheless, there were persistent reports of males and females differing in non-reproductive parameters, such as performance on learning tasks 1\textendash 4 , and associated neuro physiological correlates like hippo campal long-term potentiation (LTP) 2 and cortical synapse number 5 . Parallel to animal studies was the advent of functional MRI, which allowed for assessment of human brain activity in real time and provided the opportunity to revisit the ageless question 'do men and women think differently?' Functional MRI studies revealing such differences have involved tasks assessing verbal recall, spatial learning, non-verbal reasoning, emotional face reading, fear and anxiety, and responses to sexually explicit stimuli, as well as the impact of stress on most of these tasks (for a review, see REF. 6). Similarly, the emer-gence of diffusion tensor imaging revealed sex differences in the connectome: girls and young women were found to have stronger interhemispheric connections, whereas boys and young men had greater intra hemispheric con-nections 7},

The relationship between 10 different traits for females, seven traits for males, and overall fitness (lifetime recruitment) was quantified for great tits (Parus major) studied in their natural environment of Wytham Wood, England, using data collected over 39 years. Heritabilities and the coefficients of additive genetic and residual variance (CVA and CVR, respectively) were estimated using an "animal model." For both males and females, a trait's correlation (r) with fitness was negatively related to its h2 but positively related to its CVR. The CVA was not related to the trait's correlation with fitness in either sex.

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. Music is present in every culture, but the degree to which it is shaped by biology remains debated. One widely discussed phenomenon is that some combinations of notes are perceived by Westerners as pleasant, or consonant, whereas others are perceived as unpleasant, or dissonant. The contrast between consonance and dissonance is central to Western music, and its origins have fascinated scholars since the ancient Greeks. Aesthetic responses to consonance are commonly assumed by scientists to have biological roots, and thus to be universally present in humans. Ethnomusicologists and composers, in contrast, have argued that consonance is a creation of Western musical culture. The issue has remained unresolved, partly because little is known about the extent of cross-cultural variation in consonance preferences. Here we report experiments with the Tsimane'-a native Amazonian society with minimal exposure to Western culture-and comparison populations in Bolivia and the United States that varied in exposure to Western music. Participants rated the pleasantness of sounds. Despite exhibiting Western-like discrimination abilities and Western-like aesthetic responses to familiar sounds and acoustic roughness, the Tsimane' rat ed consonant and dissonant chords and vocal harmonies as equally pleasant. By contrast, Bolivian city-and town-dwellers exhibited significant preferences for consonance, albeit to a lesser degree than US residents. The results indicate that consonance preferences can be absent in cultures sufficiently isolated from Western music, and are thus unlikely to reflect innate biases or exposure to harmonic natural sounds. The observed variation in preferences is presumably determined by exposure to musical harmony, suggesting that culture has a dominant role in shaping aesthetic responses to music.},

According to this view, song copying is a form of deceptive mimicry. We show that first-year great tits do not share more songs than expected with the previous occupants of their territories, nor are shared songs used more often than other songs in their repertoires. Songs are shared with neighbours but not selectively with established neighbours and there is no difference in reproductive success between great tits sharing with established neighbours and with first-year neighbours. We discuss the general applicability of the deceptive mimicry hypothesis and suggest that song sharing between neighbours may be advantageous for reasons other than deceptive mimicry. \textcopyright{} 1984.},

Sperm competition may have been a recurrent adaptive problem over human evolutionary history (Shackelford \& Pound, 2006). Women's orgasm may facilitate selective uptake and retention of a particular man's sperm (Thornhill \& Gangestad, 2008). Men who are more satisfied with and invested in their relationship may experience greater costs in the event of sperm competition and potential cuckoldry. Therefore, these men may be especially interested in ensuring their partner's copulatory orgasm. We hypothesized that men's relationship satisfaction and investment would predict interest in their partner's copulatory orgasm, and that sperm competition risk would moderate the association between relationship satisfaction and interest in partner's copulatory orgasm. Using structural equation modeling on self-report data secured from 229 men in a committed heterosexual relationship, we tested and found support for these hypotheses. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The sequences in which songbirds deliver their songs may help serve song's primary functions related to territorial defense and mate attraction but determining that requires a clear understanding of the syntax of the species in question. Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus) males sing with a degree of predictability, cycling up and down the frequency spectrum with immediate variety. The present work used two complementary approaches to better understand Hermit Thrush song syntax by investigating the degree to which song type choice relies upon the identity of preceding songs within large ({$>$} 1000) song sets from 12 males. In one analysis, Fisher's tests were used to assess whether the song immediately before the next song\textemdash or two, three, or four spots before it\textemdash influenced the next song. Results indicated that the next song is influenced by both the previous song and the one before it, and less so by those three or four songs back. In addition, simulated sequences were generated that reflect Markov models from zero-order (the next song depends on no preceding songs) through fourth-order (it depends on the previous four songs), and then compared back to the bird's observed song sequence. This analysis revealed that naturally occurring sequences are best described by second-order Markov models, indicating a reliance upon the previous two songs. Together, the results indicate that Hermit Thrush song sequences are determined mainly by preceding two songs. Future work will further explore the presence of higher level dependencies, along with the role of syntax in territorial defense and aggression.},

These songs gradually change over the course of the breeding season, and are generally population specific. However, instances have been recorded of more rapid song changes where the song of a population can be replaced by the song of an adjacent population. The mechanisms that drive these changes are not currently understood, and difficulties in tracking individual whales over long migratory routes mean field studies to understand these mechanisms are not feasible. In order to help understand the mechanisms that drive these song changes, we present here a spatially explicit agent-based model inspired by methods used in computer music research. We model the migratory patterns of humpback whales, a simple song learning and production method coupled with sound transmission loss, and how often singing occurs during these migratory cycles. This model is then extended to include learning biases that may be responsible for driving changes in the song, such as a bias towards novel song, production errors, and the coupling of novel song bias and production errors. While none of the methods showed population song replacement, our model shows that shared feeding grounds where conspecifics are able to mix provide key opportunities for cultural transmission, and that production errors facilitated gradually changing songs. Our results point towards other learning biases being necessary in order for population song replacement to occur.},

These methods are already used to automatically classify animal vocalizations, for example, in identifying animal species and estimating numbers of individuals. Despite this potential, they have not yet found widespread application in animal welfare monitoring. In this review, we first discuss current trends in sound analysis for ecology, conservation and sound classification. Following this, we detail the vocalizations produced by three of the most important farm livestock species: chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and cattle (Bos taurus). Finally, we describe how these methods can be applied to monitor animal welfare with new potential for developing automated methods for large-scale farming.},

  abstract = {Although FST is widely used as a measure of population structure, it has been criticized recently because of its dependency on within-population diversity. This dependency can lead to difficulties in interpretation and in the comparison of estimates among species or among loci and has led to the development of two replacement statistics, F{${'}$}ST and D. F{${'}$}ST is the normal FST standardized by the maximum value it can obtain, given the observed within-population diversity. D uses a multiplicative partitioning of diversity, based on the effective number of alleles rather than on the expected heterozygosity. In this study, we review the relationships between the three classes of statistics (FST, F{${'}$}ST and D), their estimation and their properties. We illustrate the relationships between the statistics using a data set of estimates from 84 species taken from the last 4 years of Molecular Ecology. As with FST, unbiased estimators are available for the two new statistics D and F{${'}$}ST. Here, we develop a new unbiased F{${'}$}ST estimator based on GST, which we call G{${'}{'}$}ST. However, F{${'}$}ST can be calculated using any FST estimator for which the maximum value can be obtained. As all three statistics have their advantages and their drawbacks, we recommend continued use of FST in combination with either F{${'}$}ST or D. In most cases, F{${'}$}ST would be the best choice among the latter two as it is most suited for inferences of the influence of demographic processes such as genetic drift and migration on genetic population structure.},

Many methods for computing similarity have been developed, but their performance has not been extensively characterized in noisy environments and with vocalizations characterized by complex frequency modulations. This paper describes methods of bioacoustic comparison based on dynamic time warping (DTW) of the fundamental frequency or spectrogram. Fundamental frequency is estimated using a Bayesian particle filter adaptation of harmonic template matching. The methods were tested on field recordings of flight calls from superb starlings, Lamprotornis superbus, for how well they could separate distinct categories of call elements (motifs). The fundamental-frequency-based method performed best, but the spectrogram-based method was less sensitive to noise. Both DTW methods provided better separation of categories than spectrographic cross correlation, likely due to substantial variability in the duration of superb starling flight call motifs.},

  abstract = {Studies suggest that heightened peripheral inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder. We investigated the effect of chronic social defeat stress, a mouse model of depression, on blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and infiltration of peripheral immune signals. We found reduced expression of the endothelial cell tight junction protein claudin-5 (Cldn5) and abnormal blood vessel morphology in nucleus accumbens (NAc) of stress-susceptible but not resilient mice. CLDN5 expression was also decreased in NAc of depressed patients. Cldn5 downregulation was sufficient to induce depression-like behaviors following subthreshold social stress whereas chronic antidepressant treatment rescued Cldn5 loss and promoted resilience. Reduced BBB integrity in NAc of stress-susceptible or mice injected with adeno-associated virus expressing shRNA against Cldn5 caused infiltration of the peripheral cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) into brain parenchyma and subsequent expression of depression-like behaviors. These findings suggest that chronic social stress alters BBB integrity through loss of tight junction protein Cldn5, promoting peripheral IL-6 passage across the BBB and depression.},

I discuss synergistic interactions foundational to the syndemics construct through my research of depression and diabetes comorbidity in vulnerable populations from urban United States, India, and South Africa. I argue that social and economic factors that cluster with depression and diabetes alone and together exemplify the biosocial processes that are at the heart of syndemics. In doing so, I illustrate how social, cultural, and economic factors shape individual-level experiences of co-occurring diseases despite similar population-level trends. Finally, I discuss the relevance of syndemics for the fields of medicine and public health while cautioning what must not be lost in translation across disciplines.},

  abstract = {The co-occurrence of health burdens in transitioning populations, particularly in specific socioeconomic and cultural contexts, calls for conceptual frameworks to improve understanding of risk factors, so as to better design and implement prevention and intervention programmes to address comorbidities. The concept of a syndemic, developed by medical anthropologists, provides such a framework for preventing and treating comorbidities. The term syndemic refers to synergistic health problems that affect the health of a population within the context of persistent social and economic inequalities. Until now, syndemic theory has been applied to comorbid health problems in poor immigrant communities in high-income countries with limited translation, and in low-income or middle-income countries. In this Series paper, we examine the application of syndemic theory to comorbidities and multimorbidities in low-income and middle-income countries. We employ diabetes as an exemplar and discuss its comorbidity with HIV in Kenya, tuberculosis in India, and depression in South Africa. Using a model of syndemics that addresses transactional pathophysiology, socioeconomic conditions, health system structures, and cultural context, we illustrate the different syndemics across these countries and the potential benefit of syndemic care to patients. We conclude with recommendations for research and systems of care to address syndemics in low-income and middle-income country settings.},

In Experiment 2, another two groups were asked to produce sequences that others might appreciate as agentive or nonrandom. Participant-generated sequences in the two con-ditions had a substantial overlap, indicating common guiding principles of agency and nonrandomness generation.

  abstract = {Hierarchical organization\textemdash the recursive composition of sub-modules\textemdash is ubiquitous in biological networks, including neural, metabolic, ecological, and genetic regulatory networks, and in human-made systems, such as large organizations and the Internet. To date, most research on hierarchy in networks has been limited to quantifying this property. However, an open, important question in evolutionary biology is why hierarchical organization evolves in the first place. It has recently been shown that modularity evolves because of the presence of a cost for network connections. Here we investigate whether such connection costs also tend to cause a hierarchical organization of such modules. In computational simulations, we find that networks without a connection cost do not evolve to be hierarchical, even when the task has a hierarchical structure. However, with a connection cost, networks evolve to be both modular and hierarchical, and these networks exhibit higher overall performance and evolvability (i.e. faster adaptation to new environments). Additional analyses confirm that hierarchy independently improves adaptability after controlling for modularity. Overall, our results suggest that the same force\textendash the cost of connections\textendash promotes the evolution of both hierarchy and modularity, and that these properties are important drivers of network performance and adaptability. In addition to shedding light on the emergence of hierarchy across the many domains in which it appears, these findings will also accelerate future research into evolving more complex, intelligent computational brains in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.},

Experimental studies of laboratory-reared animals support this hypothesis for vocal learning [5-7], yet we lack experimental evidence of vocal learning in wild animals. We developed an innovative playback technology involving automated loudspeakers that broadcast songs with distinctive acoustic signatures. We used this technology to simulate vocal tutors in the wild and conducted year-long tutoring sessions to five cohorts of free-living migratory Savannah Sparrows in eastern Canada. We confirm that wild birds learn songs by listening to adult conspecific animals, and we show that they pass these songs on to subsequent generations. Further, we provide the first experimental evidence in the wild that the timing of exposure to tutor song influences vocal learning: wild Savannah Sparrows preferentially learn songs heard during both their natal summer and at the outset of their first breeding season. This research provides direct experimental evidence of song learning by wild animals and shows that wild birds learn songs during two critical stages of development early in life.},

  abstract = {Animals often live within close proximity of multiple conspecific individuals, allowing them to eavesdrop on other animals' signalling interactions to guide their own social behaviours. For a young animal that is learning to vocalize, eavesdropping on vocal interactions between adults may provide a rich source of information: young animals might preferentially learn vocalizations that are commonly heard in interactions between adults or that are heard to be effective for attracting mates or defending resources. We used a multispeaker playback experiment with wild Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, to test the hypothesis that vocal learning is guided by eavesdropping. Over a 6-year period, we tutored young Savannah sparrows with experimental tutor songs; half of the tutor songs were broadcast in simulated vocal interactions between two tutors, and the other half were broadcast as noninteractive, stand-alone solo performances. If eavesdropping plays an important role in guiding vocal learning, we predicted that young birds would preferentially learn the vocalizations heard during interactions between tutors. In contrast to our prediction, young Savannah sparrows did not preferentially learn interactive tutor songs; birds were similarly likely to learn songs heard in an interactive context (N = 13) and in a noninteractive context (N = 17). Analysis of live adult tutors' reactions to the loudspeakers showed that they responded with similar vocal behaviour during interactive and noninteractive treatments, and therefore their vocal behaviour did not compromise the playback simulation. We conclude that eavesdropping on vocal interactions between tutors does not appear to be essential for vocal learning of wild Savannah sparrows.},

We take this capacity to ``entrain'' to an evenly paced stimulus (isochrony) so much for granted that it may come as a surprise to learn that from a biological point of view such behaviour is exceptional. But it is not altogether unique. There are a number of other species, none of them closely related to humans, that also engage in group synchrony of behaviour through entrainment to an isochronous pulse. Despite their evolutionary distance from us their life circumstances throw an interesting light on the possible origin and nature of our own entrainment capacity.

This latter claim is tested by outlining the methods and approaches employed by the principal subdisciplines of evolutionary biology and assessing whether there is an existing or potential corresponding approach to the study of cultural evolution. Existing approaches within anthropology and archaeology demonstrate a good match with the macroevolutionary methods of systematics, paleobiology, and biogeography, whereas mathematical models derived from population genetics have been successfully developed to study cultural microevolution. Much potential exists for experimental simulations and field studies of cultural microevolution, where there are opportunities to borrow further methods and hypotheses from biology. Potential also exists for the cultural equivalent of molecular genetics in "social cognitive neuroscience," although many fundamental issues have yet to be resolved.

  abstract = {In this paper, we explore how experimental studies of cultural transmission in adult humans can address general questions regarding the 'who, what, when and how' of human cultural transmission, and consequently inform a theory of human cultural evolution. Three methods are discussed. The transmission chain method, in which information is passed along linear chains of participants, has been used to identify content biases in cultural transmission. These concern the kind of information that is transmitted. Several such candidate content biases have now emerged from the experimental literature. The replacement method, in which participants in groups are gradually replaced or moved across groups, has been used to study phenomena such as cumulative cultural evolution, cultural group selection and cultural innovation. The closed-group method, in which participants learn in groups with no replacement, has been used to explore issues such as who people choose to learn from and when they learn culturally as opposed to individually. A number of the studies reviewed here have received relatively little attention within their own disciplines, but we suggest that these, and future experimental studies of cultural transmission that build on them, can play an important role in a broader science of cultural evolution.},

Yet there is accruing evidence for systematic individual variation in social learning within species. Here we review evidence for this individual variation, placing it within a continuum of increasing phenotypic plasticity, from genetically polymorphic personality traits, to developmental plasticity via cues such as maternal stress, to the individual learning of social learning, and finally the social learning of social learning. The latter, possibly restricted to humans, can generate stable between-group cultural variation in social learning. More research is needed to understand the extent, causes, and consequences of this individual and cultural variation. Social learning is often assumed to be a universal, species-typical capacity. We review evidence showing non-trivial individual variation in social learning.This individual variation has multiple causes, reflecting phenotypic plasticity.Individual variation in social learning has important evolutionary consequences.},

  abstract = {The last two decades have seen an explosion in research analysing cultural change as a Darwinian evolutionary process. Here I provide an overview of the theory of cultural evolution, including its intellectual history, major theoretical tenets and methods, key findings, and prominent criticisms and controversies. `Culture' is defined as socially transmitted information. Cultural evolution is the theory that this socially transmitted information evolves in the manner laid out by Darwin in The Origin of Species, i.e. it comprises a system of variation, differential fitness and inheritance. Cultural evolution is not, however, neo-Darwinian, in that many of the details of genetic evolution may not apply, such as particulate inheritance and random mutation. Following a brief history of this idea, I review theoretical and empirical studies of cultural microevolution, which entails both selection-like processes wherein some cultural variants are more likely to be acquired and transmitted than others, plus transformative processes that alter cultural information during transmission. I also review how phylogenetic methods have been used to reconstruct cultural macroevolution, including the evolution of languages, technology and social organisation. Finally, I discuss recent controversies and debates, including the extent to which culture is proximate or ultimate, the relative role of selective and transformative processes in cultural evolution, the basis of cumulative cultural evolution, the evolution of large-scale human cooperation, and whether social learning is learned or innate. I conclude by highlighting the value of using evolutionary methods to study culture for both the social and biological sciences.},

Some researchers argue that CCE is unique to humans and underlies our extraordinary evolutionary success as a species. Others claim to have found CCE in non-human species. Yet others remain sceptical that CCE is even important for explaining human behavioural diversity and complexity. These debates are hampered by multiple and often ambiguous definitions of CCE. Here, we review how researchers define, use and test CCE. We identify a core set of criteria for CCE which are both necessary and sufficient, and may be found in non-human species. We also identify a set of extended criteria that are observed in human CCE but not, to date, in other species. Different socio-cognitive mechanisms may underlie these different criteria. We reinterpret previous theoretical models and observational and experimental studies of both human and non-human species in light of these more fine-grained criteria. Finally, we discuss key issues surrounding information, fitness and cognition. We recommend that researchers are more explicit about what components of CCE they are testing and claiming to demonstrate.},

Here, we used vocal learning in songbirds to study how experience and genetics contribute to interindividual differences in learned song. Previous work has established that such differences in song within a species depend on learning, but in principle some of these differences could also depend on genetic variation. We focused on song tempo, a learned and quantifiable feature that is controlled by central neural circuitry. To identify genetic contributions to tempo we computer-tutored juvenile Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata domestica) from different genetic backgrounds with synthetic songs in which tempo was systematically varied. Computer-tutored birds exhibited unexpectedly strong heritability for song tempo and comparatively weak influence of experience. We then tested whether heritability was fixed and independent of experience by providing a second group of birds with enriched instruction via live social tutoring. Live tutoring resulted in not only a significant increase in the influence of experience on tempo but also a dramatic decrease in the influence of genetics, indicating that enriched instruction could overcome genetic biases evident under computer tutoring. Our results reveal strong heritable genetic contributions to interindividual variation in song tempo but that the degree of heritability depends profoundly on the quality of instruction. They suggest that for more complex learned phenotypes, where it can be difficult to identify and control relevant experiential variables, heritability may similarly be contingent on the specifics of experience.},

This assessment can be impeded by the often complex, multidimensional nature of behavior. We present a novel, automated approach to evaluating imitative learning. Conceptually, our approach estimates how much of the content present in a reference behavior is absent from the learned behavior. We validate our approach through examination of songbird vocalizations, complex learned behaviors the study of which has provided many insights into sensory-motor learning in general and vocal learning in particular. Historically, learning has been holistically assessed by human inspection or through comparison of specific song features selected by experimenters (e.g. fundamental frequency, spectral entropy). In contrast, our approach uses statistical models to broadly capture the structure of each song, and then estimates the divergence between the two models. We show that our measure of song learning (the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two distributions corresponding to specific song data, or, Song DKL) is well correlated with human evaluation of song learning. We then expand the analysis beyond learning and show that Song DKL also detects the typical song deterioration that occurs following deafening. Finally, we illustrate how this measure can be extended to quantify differences in other complex behaviors such as human speech and handwriting. This approach potentially provides a framework for assessing learning across a broad range of behaviors like song that can be described as a set of discrete and repeated motor actions.},

We use both cross-fostering and computerized instruction with synthetic songs to demonstrate that matching the tutor song to individual predispositions can improve learning across genetic backgrounds. Moreover, we find that optimizing instruction in this fashion can equalize learning differences across individuals that might otherwise be construed as genetically determined. Our results demonstrate potent, synergistic interactions between experience and genetics in shaping song, and indicate the likely importance of such interactions for other complex learned behaviors.},

It reviews existing structural approaches to stigma and health inequalities developed outside of medicine, and proposes changes to U.S. medical education that will infuse clinical training with a structural focus. The approach, termed ``structural competency,'' consists of training in five core competencies: 1) recognizing the structures that shape clinical interactions; 2) developing an extra-clinical language of structure; 3) rearticulating ``cultural'' formulations in structural terms; 4) observing and imagining structural interventions; and 5) developing structural humility. Examples are provided of structural health scholarship that should be adopted into medical didactic curricula, and of structural interventions that can provide participant-observation opportunities for clinical trainees. The paper ultimately argues that increasing recognition of the ways in which social and economic forces produce symptoms or methylate genes then needs to be better coupled with medical models for structural change.},

  abstract = {From the molecular to the ecosystem level, a biological system can often be represented as a set of entities that interact with each other. Recent advances in data acquisition technology (e.g., high-throughput sequencing or tracking devices) open up the opportunity to quantify these interactions and call for the development of ambitious methodology to tackle these data. In this context, networks are widely used in biology, bioinformatics, ecology, neuroscience, or epidemiology to represent interaction data [{$<$}a class="ref-tip" href="\#pcbi.1007434.ref001"{$>$}1{$<$}/a{$>$}]. A network contains a set of entities (the nodes or vertices) that are connected by edges (or links) depicting some interactions or relationships. These relationships may be either directly observed or deduced from raw data. The first case encompasses protein\textendash protein interaction (PPI) networks\textemdash in which interactions between 2 proteins are experimentally assessed\textemdash or plant\textendash pollinator interactions that are directly observed in the field. Gene regulatory networks reconstructed from gene expression data, co-occurrence networks inferred from species abundances, or animal social contact networks deduced from Global Positioning System (GPS) tracks are some examples of the second case. New kinds of networks are still emerging (for instance, cell\textendash cell similarity networks [{$<$}a class="ref-tip" href="\#pcbi.1007434.ref002"{$>$}2{$<$}/a{$>$}], Hi-C networks, and image similarity networks [{$<$}a class="ref-tip" href="\#pcbi.1007434.ref003"{$>$}3{$<$}/a{$>$}]). Networks are very attractive objects, and many methods have been developed to analyze their structure. However, biological networks are often analyzed by nonspecialists, and it may be difficult for them to navigate through the plethora of concepts and available methods. In this paper, we propose 9 tips to avoid common pitfalls and enhance the analysis of network data by biologists.}

  abstract = {Many animals use acoustic signals for communication, implying that the properties of these signals can be under strong selection. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis predicts that species living in dense habitats emit lower-frequency sounds than those in open areas, because low-frequency sounds generally propagate further in denser vegetation. Signal frequency may also be under sexual selection, because it correlates with body size and lower-frequency sounds are perceived as more intimidating. Here, we evaluate these hypotheses by analysing variation in peak song frequency across 5,085 passerine species (Passeriformes). A phylogenetically-informed analysis revealed that song frequency decreases with increasing body mass and with male-biased sexual size dimorphism. However, we found no support for the predicted relationship between frequency and habitat. Our results suggest that the global variation in passerine song frequency is mostly driven by natural and sexual selection causing evolutionary shifts in body size rather than by habitat-related selection on sound propagation.Statement of authorship TA and PM conceived and designed the study with input from all authors.

This led to the theory that depression results from impaired adult neurogenesis and restoration of adult neurogenesis leads to recovery. Follow up studies yielded a complex body of often inconsistent results, and the veracity of this theory is uncertain. We propose five criteria for acceptance of this theory, we review the recent evidence for each criterion, and we draw the following conclusions: Diverse animal models of depression and anxiety have impaired neurogenesis. Neurogenesis is consistently boosted by antidepressants in animal models only when animals are stressed. Ablation of neurogenesis in animal models impairs cognitive functions relevant to depression, but only a minority of studies find that ablation causes depression or anxiety. Recent human neuroimaging and postmortem studies are consistent with the neurogenic theory, but they are indirect. Finally, a novel drug developed based on the neurogenic theory is promising in animal models.},

We find that habitat and climate profoundly influence woodpecker plumage, and we recover support for the generality of Gloger's rule.

Instead, this convergence is associated with geographic overlap between species, suggesting occasional strong selection for interspecific mimicry.},

However, these methods face important challenges, especially regarding the operationalization of theoretical claims. In this review, we focus on the study of cumulative cultural evolution, the process by which traditions are gradually modified and, for technological traditions in particular, improved upon over time. We identify several mismatches between theoretical definitions of cumulative culture and their implementation in cultural transmission experiments. We argue that observed performance increase can be the result of participants learning faster in a group context rather than effectively leading to a cumulative effect. We also show that in laboratory experiments, participants are asked to complete quite simple tasks, which can undermine the evidential value of the diagnostic criterion traditionally used for cumulative culture (i.e. that cumulative culture is a process that produces solutions that no single individual could have invented on their own). We show that the use of unidimensional metrics of cumulativeness drastically curtail the variation that may be observed, which raises specific issues in the interpretation of the experimental evidence. We suggest several solutions to these mismatches (learning times, task complexity and variation) and develop the use of design spaces in experimentally investigating old and new questions about cumulative culture.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative methods are widely used to understand and quantify the evolution of phenotypic traits, based on phylogenetic trees and trait measurements of extant species. Such analyses depend crucially on the underlying model. Gaussian phylogenetic models like Brownian motion and Ornstein\textendash Uhlenbeck processes are the workhorses of modeling continuous-trait evolution. However, these models fit poorly to big trees, because they neglect the heterogeneity of the evolutionary process in different lineages of the tree. Previous works have addressed this issue by introducing shifts in the evolutionary model occurring at inferred points in the tree. However, for computational reasons, in all current implementations, these shifts are "intramodel," meaning that they allow jumps in 1 or 2 model parameters, keeping all other parameters "global" for the entire tree. There is no biological reason to restrict a shift to a single model parameter or, even, to a single type of model. Mixed Gaussian phylogenetic models (MGPMs) incorporate the idea of jointly inferring different types of Gaussian models associated with different parts of the tree. Here, we propose an approximate maximum-likelihood method for fitting MGPMs to comparative data comprising possibly incomplete measurements for several traits from extant and extinct phylogenetically linked species. We applied the method to the largest published tree of mammal species with body- and brain-mass measurements, showing strong statistical support for an MGPM with 12 distinct evolutionary regimes. Based on this result, we state a hypothesis for the evolution of the brain\textendash body-mass allometry over the past 160 million y.}

Their songs consist of syllables, which appear as pulse trains in sound spectrograms. When describing the song sequence, researchers consider the syllable to be the unit of the song. Moreover, artificial grammar learning studies asking whether songbirds recognize structural regularities observed in human language often design stimuli using song syllables as components. However, whether syllables are perceptual units is yet to be determined. We found that Bengalese finches, a species of songbird, responded significantly less to one specific syllable when it was temporally placed close to the preceding syllable. The proximity, or silent interval was within the range of what is produced in the natural songs of both Bengalese and zebra finches, and what has been used in other artificial grammar learning studies using zebra finches. Our results suggest the need for a reinterpretation of the description of birdsong structure and of previous artificial grammar learning studies.},

We used a variant of the classification image method in combination with a global orientation discrimination task to test whether a change in information sampling underlies training-based benefits in behavioral performance. The results revealed that decreases in orientation thresholds with perceptual learning were accompanied by increases in stimulus sampling. In particular, while stimulus sampling was restricted to the parafoveal, inner portion of the stimulus before training, we observed an outward spread of sampling after training. These results demonstrate that the benefits of perceptual learning may arise, in part, from a strategic increase in the efficiency with which the observer samples information from a visual stimulus.},

To this end, we consider the similarities between birdsong structure and the prosodic hierarchy in human speech and between context-dependent acoustic variations in birdsong and the biological codes in human speech. Moreover, we discuss songbirds' sensitivity to prosody-like acoustic features and the role of such features in song segmentation and song learning in relation to infants' sensitivity to prosody and the role of prosody in early language acquisition. Finally, we make suggestions for future comparative birdsong research, including a framework of how prosody in birdsong can be studied. In particular, we propose to analyze birdsong as a multidimensional signal composed of specific acoustic features, and to assess whether these acoustic features are organized into prosody-like structures.},

I tested whether floral symmetry reliably reflects phenotypic quality measured in terms of pollinator rewards and whether pollinators respond to floral symmetry in a series of observations and experiments on Epilobium angustifolium (Onagraceae). Lower petal asymmetry was negatively related to mean lower petal length, whereas asymmetry in leaf width was positively related to mean leaf width. Flowers visited by bumblebees were larger and more symmetrical than the nearest neighboring flower. This relationship between pollinator preference for large and symmetrical flowers was demonstrated to be causal in experiments in which the lower petals were manipulated symmetrically or asymmetrically. Nectar production was larger in symmetrical flowers, and this may explain the bumblebee preference for flower symmetry. Floral symmetry therefore reliably reflects nectar production and hence enhances pollen transport. Extensive embryo abortion has been documented in E. angustifolium and other outcrossing plant species. Floral fluctuating asymmetry, which reflects general developmental homeostasis, may explain such developmental selection in these plants.}

The occurrence of non-utilitarian lithic objects, often modified, in Middle Stone Age or Upper Paleolithic sites is now widely accepted as evidence of symbolic behavior associated with the appearance of Homo sapiens. However the occurrence of non-utilitarian and unusual objects in far earlier sites raises questions about their significance. Our purpose is not to discuss their meaning, which is unknown to us, but to approach their diversity and to trace their evolution. From the earliest beginnings of mankind, various objects have been found in the occupation sites that have no apparent functional link with any technical activity or food procurement. This type of object is more obvious from the Acheulian times onwards and then becomes common in the Late Pleistocene. The inventory and classification according to the object characteristics (raw material, color, shape, degree of transformation, etc.) and the context of the sites (chronology, stratigraphy, paleoenvironment) help in identifying specific hominin behavior. Perhaps they were intended to convey symbolic expression, quite vague in any case for the earliest periods, but at least their occurrence in the sites suggests some non-utilitarian concerns among the people who made them. \textcopyright{} 2012, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

However, in yellow-bellied marmots, increased sociality is associated with lower female reproductive success, decreased female longevity and increased overwinter mortality for both males and females, which raises questions about the adaptive value of sociality in this facultatively social mammal. Here we used social network analysis to examine the relationship between sociality and summer survival, which is almost always attributable to predation. Yearling females had enhanced survival when they had stronger social relationships and were more central in their network. Adult female survival was not associated with social network traits, but females were more likely to survive the summer if they lived in larger groups. Survival of yearling and adult males was not associated with either social network trait variation or variation in group size. These findings identify a potential benefit for marmot sociality and an explanation for marmot colony social structuring.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

In most mammals other than humans, vocalizations are specified by innate mechanisms and develop normally in the absence of auditory experience. By contrast, juvenile songbirds memorize and copy the songs of adult tutors, a process with many parallels to human speech learning. Despite the centrality of vocal learning to human speech, vocal production in humans as well as in songbirds exploits ancestral circuitry for innate vocalizations, and effective vocal communication depends on the fluent blending of innate and learned elements. This review covers recent advances in our understanding of central mechanisms for learned and innate vocalizations in birds and mice, including brainstem mechanisms that help to 'gate' vocalizations on or off, cortical involvement in learned and innate vocalizations, and the delineation of circuits that evaluate and reinforce song performance to facilitate vocal learning.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Neurons in the deep region of primary auditory cortex responded more to conspecific songs than to other species' songs and more to species-typical spectrotemporal modulations, but neurons in the intermediate (thalamorecipient) region did not. Moreover, birds that learned song from another species exhibited parallel shifts in selectivity and tuning toward the tutor species' songs in the deep but not the intermediate region. Our results locate a region in the auditory processing hierarchy where an experience-dependent coding mechanism aligns auditory responses with the output of a learned vocal motor behavior.}

Traditional data-driven analyses of perceptual similarity are based on heuristics or simplified linear models, and are thus limited.

Such labels are not always feasible to acquire. We explore data-driven neural embeddings for sound event representation when class labels are absent, instead utilising proxies of perceptual similarity judgements. Ultimately, our target is to create a perceptual embedding space that reflects animals' perception of sound. We create deep perceptual embeddings for bird sounds using triplet models. In order to deal with the challenging nature of triplet loss training with the lack of class-labelled data, we utilise multidimensional scaling (MDS) pretraining, attention pooling, and a triplet mining scheme. We also evaluate the advantage of triplet learning compared to learning a neural embedding from a model trained on MDS alone. Using computational proxies of similarity judgements, we demonstrate the feasibility of the method to develop perceptual models for a wide range of data based on behavioural judgements, helping us understand how animals perceive sounds.},

All three were conventional men, but they all developed theories with radical and revolutionary implications. All were concerned with "evolution" in one form or another, putting them in conflict with religious and intellectual orthodoxy. Morgan believed it both natural and proper to learn by what stages of growth mankind had risen from savagery to civilization.In his important new introduction, Robin Fox reviews the developmental and social evolutionary thesis put forward by Morgan in light of what we have learned from the twentieth century. Ancient Society defines three major stages in the cultural and social evolution of mankind. Morgan describes how savages, advancing by definite steps, attained the higher condition of barbarism. He then explores how barbarians, by similar progressive advancement, finally attained civilization. Finally he discusses why other tribes and nations have been left behind in the race of progress. Inventions and discoveries show the similarity of human wants at the same stages of advancement, thus demonstrating the psychic unity of mankind. The idea of property - now an obsession in civilized society - underwent a similar process of growth and development, as did the principles of government. By the "comparative method" of using existing and historical societies as examples of previous stages, the history of human progress could be reconstructed. These parallel lines along the pathways of human progress form the principal subjects of discussion in Ancient Society.In his opening statement Robin Foxargues that social science was wrong to dismiss the comparative method, and paid a great price in the fragmentation of the unity of purpose that Morgan's method provided. Ancient Society's great cultural import with its lasting wisdom will be of interest to scholars and students in the social sciences and all those interested in the question of the unity of the sciences of mankind.},

  abstract = {This discussion paper responds to two recent articles in Biology and Philosophy that raise similar objections to cultural attraction theory, a research trend in cultural evolution putting special emphasis on the fact that human minds create and transform their culture. Both papers are sympathetic to this idea, yet both also regret a lack of consilience with Boyd, Richerson and Henrich's models of cultural evolution. I explain why cultural attraction theorists propose a different view on three points of concern for our critics. I start by detailing the claim that cultural transmission relies not chiefly on imitation or teaching, but on cognitive mecha-nisms like argumentation, ostensive communication, or selective trust, whose evolved or habitual function may not be the faithful reproduction of ideas or behaviours. Second, I explain why the distinction between context biases and content biases might not always be the best way to capture the interactions between culture and cognition. Lastly, I show that cultural attraction models cannot be reduced to a model of guided variation, which posits a clear separation between individual and social learning processes. With cultural attraction, the same cognitive mechanisms underlie both innovation and the preservation of traditions. Replying to a book review is rather unusual; even more so when it is as generous and perceptive as Andrew Buskell's critique of How Traditions Live and Die (Buskell 2015; Morin 2016). Buskell's essay presents important challenges for my book's claims. Some of his concerns echo those that have been voiced by Alberto Acerbi and Alex Mesoudi, also in this journal (Acerbi and Mesoudi 2015). Both articles present, with great sympathy and care, a research trend known today as ''cultural attraction theory'' (Sperber 1996; Claidi\`ere et al. 2014). Cultural attraction is a way of seeing cultural change that tries to take individual cognition as seriously as possible. It shares many features with other theories of cultural evolution (those of Robert Boyd, Peter Richerson, Joseph Henrich, or Alex Mesoudi); yet its proponents (myself included) have also gone against the grain of much cultural evolution research, by criticising the use of selectionist models to study cultural change; by having ostensive communication, argumentation, or selective trust, replace teaching and imitation as the chief engines of cultural transmission; or by challenging models of cultural group selection. Buskell, Acerbi and Mesoudi all concur that cultural attraction theorists make some valid points, but they also agree that is not as different or special as it takes itself to be. Had we paid better attention to other approaches, we would find that many of our concerns have already been successfully addressed in the cultural evolution mainstream. In particular, both Buskell's paper (2015) and Acerbi and Mesoudi's (2015: 485) invite us to seek agreement with Boyd and Richerson's theoretical framework, whenever possible. I take them as sensible invitations to gloss over superficial differences, in the interest of a young discipline in need of cohesion. I will consider three points of concern for Buskell or Acerbi and Mesoudi. On these three points, I believe that cultural attraction theorists have made an original contribution that usefully complements other approaches. Our critics doubt this. These three issues are the role of imitation in cultural transmission, the impact of cognitive constraints on culture (''content biases'' in Boyd and Richerson's framework), and the importance of transformation, as opposed to selection, in cultural change (which our critics argue can be reduced to ''guided variation''). Does it matter whether cultural transmission is imitative or not?},

  abstract = {A cultural practice can spread because it is transmitted with high fidelity, but also because biased transformation leads to its reinvention. The respective effect of these two mechanisms, however, may only be quantified if we can measure and detect high-fidelity transmission. This paper proposes wholesale copying, the reproduction of a set of elements as a set, as an operational definition. Using two corpus of heraldic designs (total n = 13,453), we apply information-theoretic tools to detect cases of wholesale copying and gauge their incidence. Heraldic designs are composed according to rigorous combinatorial rules. Wholesale copying causes the frequency of a design to increase out of proportion with the frequency of the motif and tinctures that make it up. Comparing the frequency of designs with that of their component motifs and tinctures, we show that the amount of information carried by a design tracks its inheritance along family lines. A model predicting the frequency of heraldic designs based solely on the frequency of their component parts systematically outperforms one that assumes a mix of wholesale copying and random mutation (with realistic mutation rates). These findings are consistent with low but non-null incidences of wholesale copying in the diffusion of heraldic designs.},

As this study of 116 scripts shows, the orientation of strokes inside written characters massively favors cardinal directions, and it is organized in such a way as to make letter recogni-tion easier: Cardinal and oblique strokes tend not to mix, and mirror symmetry is anisotropic, favoring vertical over horizontal symmetry. Phylogenetic analyses and recently invented scripts show that cultural evolution over the last three millennia cannot be the sole cause of these effects.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Personality traits and their correlations have been shown to be linked with life history strategies and fitness in various species. Among-individual correlations (i.e. behavioural syndromes) between personality traits can affect the evolutionary responses of these traits to environmental variation. Understanding the genetic and ecological determinants of personality traits and their interactions as behavioural syndromes in the wild is thus needed to shed light on the mechanisms shaping their evolution. Partitioning the observed (co)variance in these traits, however, requires large numbers of repeated behavioural measures on many individuals of known relatedness level. In the absence of such data, it is thus often assumed that phenotypic (co)variances inform about (i) underlying among-individual (co)variances (i.e. ignoring within-individual (co)variances) and (2) underlying genetic (co)variances. We tested these assumptions using three personality traits collected during 3 years on a long-term monitored breeding population of collared flycatchers, {$<$}em{$>$}Ficedula albicollis{$<$}/em{$>$}. We partitioned the observed phenotypic (co)variance of aggressiveness, boldness and neophobia into genetic, permanent environment and parental components, and we estimated the repeatability, and heritability of these traits and their among-individual correlations. All three traits were repeatable between years (at least on the latent scale) but none were heritable. Permanent environment effects explained 15\% of the phenotypic variance in aggressiveness, and parental effects explained 25\% of the phenotypic variance in neophobia, in line with previous studies in wild populations. The three traits showed phenotypic correlations but no among-individual correlations and no additive genetic covariance. Thus, our results did not support the assumptions that phenotypic covariance reflects behavioural syndromes and genetic covariance. We discuss the reasons for the absence of heritability and among-individual and genetic covariance between these three personality traits in light of the possible selective pressures acting on this population.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Assessing local habitat quality via social cues provided by conspecific or heterospecific individuals sharing the same needs is a widespread strategy of social information use for breeding habitat selection. However, gathering information about putative competitors may involve agonistic costs. The use of social cues reflecting local habitat quality acquired from a distance, such as acoustic cues, could therefore be favoured. Bird songs are conspicuous signals commonly assumed to reliably reflect producer quality, and thereby local site quality. Birds of various species have been shown to be attracted to breeding sites by conspecific and heterospecific songs, and to use conspecific song features as information on producer (and by extension habitat) quality. Whether they can do the same with heterospecific song features, and whether this depends on the individual's own phenotype and especially its competitive ability, remains unknown. We used a playback experiment in a wild population of collared flycatchers, {$<$}em{$>$}Ficedula albicollis{$<$}/em{$>$}, a species known to eavesdrop on the presence and performance of dominant great tits, {$<$}em{$>$}Parus major{$<$}/em{$>$}. We tested whether flycatchers, whose aggressiveness was experimentally assessed, preferred to settle near playback of a high-quality great tit song (i.e. song with large repertoire size, long strophes, high song rate), a low-quality great tit song or a chaffinch song (control). Among old females, aggressive ones preferred to settle near playback of high-quality tit song and avoided playback of low-quality tit song, while less aggressive females preferred to settle near playback of low-quality tit song. Male personality or age did not influence settlement decisions. This shows that collared flycatcher females use great tit song quality features as information for settlement decisions, although this depended on their own competitive ability and/or previous experience with great tit songs. Our study therefore further illustrates the complex condition-dependent use of heterospecific social information for breeding habitat selection.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Similarly, it is of particular interest to biologists how much effect past behavioral records of individual animals have on their future behavioral decisions. In particular, birdsong serves a representative case to study context dependency in sequential signals produced by animals. Previous studies have suggested that the songs of Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata var. domestica) exhibited a long dependency on previous outputs, while their estimates were upper-bounded by methodological limitations at that time. This study newly estimated the context dependency in Bengalese finch's song in a more scalable manner using a neural network-based language model, Transformer, whose accessible context length reaches 900 tokens and is thus nearly free from model limitations, unlike the methods adopted in previous studies. A quantitative comparison with a parallel analysis of English sentences revealed that context dependency in Bengalese finch song is much shorter than that in human language but is comparable to human language syntax that excludes semantic factors of dependency. Our findings are in accordance with the previous generalization reported in related studies that birdsong is more homologous to human language syntax than the entire human language, including semantics. Thus, this study supports the hypothesis that human language modules, such as syntax and semantics, evolved from different precursors that are shared with other animals.}

While humans naturally attend to and process many of the psychophysical cues present in musical information, there is a great \textemdash{} and often culture-specific \textemdash{} diversity of musical practices differentiated in part by form, timbre, pitch, rhythm, and other structural elements. Musical interactions situated within a given cultural context begin to influence human responses to music as early as one year of age. Despite the world's diversity of musical cultures, the majority of research in cognitive psychology and the cognitive neuroscience of music has been conducted on subjects and stimuli from Western music cultures. From the standpoint of cognitive neuroscience, identification of fundamental cognitive and neurological processes associated with music requires ascertaining that such processes are demonstrated by listeners from a broad range of cultural backgrounds and in relation to various musics across cultural traditions. This chapter will review current research regarding the role of enculturation in music perception and cognition and the degree to which cultural influences are reflected in brain function. Exploring music cognition from the standpoint of culture will lead to a better understanding of the core processes underlying perception and how those processes give rise to the world's diversity of music forms and expressions.},

Clines in these phenotypes may be used by both sexes in the context of sexual selection and territoriality. The ways conspecifics respond to geographic variation in phenotypes can give insights to possible behavioural barriers, but these may depend on migratory behaviour. We studied a migratory songbird, the Stonechat, and tested its responsiveness to geographic variation in male song and morphology. The traits are acquired differently, with possible implications for population divergence. Song can evolve quickly through cultural transmission, and thus may contribute more to the establishment of geographic variation than inherited morphological traits. We first quantified the diversity of song traits from different populations. We then tested the responses of free-living Stonechats of both sexes to male phenotype with playbacks and decoys, representing local and foreign stimuli derived from a range of distances from the local population.},

The validity and reliability of this instrument were assessed by administering it throughout two consecutive ovulatory cycles to 36 rigidly screened women with PMS and to 18 controls. To establish concurrent validity, scores on behavioral items were correlated with simultaneously obtained scores on lengthier, well-validated psychiatric inventories designed to measure depression rather than PMS, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Profile of Mood States. The results showed that the calendar of premenstrual experiences luteal phase score distinguished PMS women from controls correctly in 104 of 108 cycles, with a 2.8\% false-negative rate and no false positives when used for two consecutive cycles. An upper limit follicular phase score was observed beneath which all PMS and normal control subjects fell, suggesting that a higher score is not consistent with PMS. Correlation coefficients of calendar item scores with Profile of Mood States scale scores were 0.58 for tension, 0.51 for depression, 0.46 for anger, 0.61 for fatigue, and 0.57 for confusion (P less than .0001 for all correlations). The correlation of the calendar depression item with the Beck Depression Inventory score was 0.56 (P less than .0001). The test-retest reliability of the calendar given in the same phase of two consecutive menstrual cycles was high (r = 0.78, P less than .0001).

However, aggregating individual movements, to generate population-level inferences, considerably reduces information on how individual or species variability influences spatial connectivity and thus identifying the mechanisms driving network structure remains difficult.Here, we propose incorporating the recent conceptual advances in multilayer network analyses with the existing movement network approach to improve our understanding of the complex interaction between spatial and/or social drivers of animal movement patterns.Specifically, we explore the application and interpretation of this framework using an empirical example of shark movement data gathered using passive remote sensors in a coral reef ecosystem. We first show how aggregating individual movement networks can lead to the loss of information, potentially misleading our interpretation of movement patterns. We then apply multilayer network analyses linking individual movement networks (i.e. layers) to the probabilities of social contact between individuals (i.e. interlayer edges) in order to explore the functional significance of different locations to an animal's ecology.This approach provides a novel and holistic framework incorporating individual variability in behaviour and inter-individual interactions. We discuss how this approach can be used in applied ecology and conservation to better assess the ecological significance of variable space use by mobile animals within a population. Further, we argue that the uptake of multilayer networks will significantly broaden our understanding of long-term ecological and evolutionary processes, particularly in the context of information or disease transfer between individuals.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate (a) whether, how, and why men pretend orgasm and (b) what men's and women's reports of pretending orgasm reveal about their sexual scripts and the functions of orgasms within these scripts. Participants were 180 male and 101 female college students; 85\% of the men and 68\% of the women had experienced penile-vaginal intercourse (PVI). Participants completed a qualitative questionnaire anonymously. Both men (25\%) and women (50\%) reported pretending orgasm (28\% and 67\%, respectively, for PVI-experienced participants). Most pretended during PVI, but some pretended during oral sex, manual stimulation, and phone sex. Frequently reported reasons were that orgasm was unlikely, they wanted sex to end, and they wanted to avoid negative consequences (e.g., hurting their partner's feelings) and to obtain positive consequences (e.g., pleasing their partner). Results suggest a sexual script in which women should orgasm before men, and men are responsible for women's orgasms.},

To investigate whether the preference for symmetric patterns is unique to humans, independent of their cultural background, we compared two human populations with distinct cultural backgrounds (Namibian hunter-gatherers and German town dwellers) with one species of non-human great apes (Orangutans) in their viewing behavior regarding symmetric and asymmetric patterns in two levels of complexity. In addition, the human participants were asked to give their aesthetic evaluation of a subset of the presented patterns. The results showed that humans of both cultural groups fixated on symmetric patterns for a longer period of time, regardless of the pattern's complexity. On the contrary, Orangutans did not clearly differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric patterns, but were much faster in processing the presented stimuli and scanned the complete screen, while both human groups rested on the symmetric pattern after a short scanning time. The aesthetic evaluation test revealed that the fixation preference for symmetric patterns did not match with the aesthetic evaluation in the Hai//om group, whereas in the German group aesthetic evaluation was in accordance with the fixation preference in 60 percent of the cases. It can be concluded that humans prefer well-ordered structures in visual processing tasks, most likely because of a positive processing bias for symmetry, which Orangutans did not show in this task, and that, in humans, an aesthetic preference does not necessarily accompany the fixation preference.},

To investigate the visual effects caused by these markings, we compared humans who have different cultural backgrounds (Namibian hunter-gatherers and German city dwellers) to one species of non-human great apes (orangutans) with respect to their perceptions of markings on objects. We used eye-tracking to analyze their fixation patterns and the durations of their fixations on marked and unmarked stones and sticks. In an additional test, humans evaluated the objects regarding their aesthetic preferences. Our hypotheses were that colorful markings help an individual to structure the surrounding world by making certain features of the environment salient, and that aesthetic appreciation should be associated with this structuring. Our results showed that humans fixated on the marked objects longer and used them in the structural processing of the objects and their background, but did not consistently report finding them more beautiful. Orangutans, in contrast, did not distinguish between object and background in their visual processing and did not clearly fixate longer on the markings. Our results suggest that marking behavior is characteristic for humans and evolved as an attention-directing rather than aesthetic benefit.},

  abstract = {Animals use vocalizations to exchange information about external events, their own physical or motivational state, or about individuality and social affiliation. Infant babbling can enhance the development of the full adult vocal repertoire by providing ample opportunity for practice. Giant otters are very social and frequently vocalizing animals. They live in highly cohesive groups, generally including a reproductive pair and their offspring born in different years. This basic social structure may vary in the degree of relatedness of the group members. Individuals engage in shared group activities and different social roles and thus, the social organization of giant otters provides a basis for complex and long-term individual relationships. We recorded and analysed the vocalizations of adult and neonate giant otters from wild and captive groups. We classified the adult vocalizations according to their acoustic structure, and described their main behavioural context. Additionally, we present the first description of vocalizations uttered in babbling bouts of new born giant otters. We expected to find 1) a sophisticated vocal repertoire that would reflect the species' complex social organisation, 2) that giant otter vocalizations have a clear relationship between signal structure and function, and 3) that the vocal repertoire of new born giant otters would comprise age-specific vocalizations as well as precursors of the adult repertoire. We found a vocal repertoire with 22 distinct vocalization types produced by adults and 11 vocalization types within the babbling bouts of the neonates. A comparison within the otter subfamily suggests a relation between vocal and social complexity, with the giant otters being the socially and vocally most complex species.},

  abstract = {To ensure good performance, modern machine learning models typically require large amounts of quality annotated data. Meanwhile, the data collection and annotation processes are usually performed manually, and consume a lot of time and resources. The quality and representativeness of curated data for a given task is usually dictated by the natural availability of clean data in the particular domain as well as the level of expertise of developers involved. In many real-world application settings it is often not feasible to obtain sufficient training data. Currently, data augmentation is the most effective way of alleviating this problem. The main goal of data augmentation is to increase the volume, quality and diversity of training data. This paper presents an extensive and thorough review of data augmentation methods applicable in computer vision domains. The focus is on more recent and advanced data augmentation techniques. The surveyed methods include deeply learned augmentation strategies as well as feature-level and meta-learning-based data augmentation techniques. Data synthesis approaches based on realistic 3D graphics modeling, neural rendering, and generative adversarial networks are also covered. Different from previous surveys, we cover a more extensive array of modern techniques and applications. We also compare the performance of several state-of-the-art augmentation methods and present a rigorous discussion of the effectiveness of various techniques in different scenarios of use based on performance results on different datasets and tasks.},

However, because nonhuman primates also exhibit preferences for certain visual qualities, it is conceivable that humans' preference for curved contours is grounded on perceptual and cognitive mechanisms shared with extant nonhuman primate species. Here we aimed to determine whether nonhuman great apes and humans share a visual preference for curved over sharp-angled contours using a 2-alternative forced choice experimental paradigm under comparable conditions. Our results revealed that the human group and the great ape group indeed share a common preference for curved over sharp-angled contours, but that they differ in the manner and magnitude with which this preference is expressed behaviorally. These results suggest that humans' visual preference for curved objects evolved from earlier primate species' visual preferences, and that during this process it became stronger, but also more susceptible to the influence of higher cognitive processes and preference for other visual features.},

Fifty-four sequences from New Zealand Maori show that the mitochondrial variability with just four haplotypes is the lowest of any sizeable human group studied and that the frequency of haplotypes is markedly skewed. The Maori sequences, combined with 268 published sequences from the Pacific, are consistent with a series of founder effects from small populations settling new island groups. The distributions of haplotypes were used to estimate the number of females in founding population of New Zealand Maori. The three-step simulation used a randomly selected founding population from eastern Polynesia, an expansionary phase in New Zealand, and finally the random selection of 54 haplotypes. The results are consistent with a founding population that includes approximately 70 women (between 50 and 100), and sensitivity analysis shows that this conclusion is robust to small changes in haplotype frequencies. This size is too large for models postulating a very small founding population of "castaways," but it is consistent with a general understanding of Maori oral history as well as the results of recent canoe voyages recreating early trans-oceanic voyages.},

The physiological basis of this perceptual simplification remains poorly understood. We used functional MRI to measure activity in a higher object processing area, the lateral occipital complex, and in primary visual cortex in response to visual elements that were either grouped into objects or randomly arranged. We observed significant activity increases in the lateral occipital complex and concurrent reductions of activity in primary visual cortex when elements formed coherent shapes, suggesting that activity in early visual areas is reduced as a result of grouping processes performed in higher areas. These findings are consistent with predictive coding models of vision that postulate that inferences of high-level areas are subtracted from incoming sensory information in lower areas through cortical feedback.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}A lot of research has been done on the effects of music and sounds on performance in many areas of study. However, there have been mixed results about what kind of effects music can have. Musical pleasure was able to influence task performance, and the shape of this effect depended on group and individual factor (Gold B., et al. 2013). According to Fassbender (2012), music does have an effect on memory, music during a study or learning phase hindered memory but increased mood and sports performance. The objective of this experiment is to find if music can help memorize different tests like nonsense syllables, numbers and poems with rhyme. Students were from different faculties, N=74 (75\% females) between age 17-22, participating in this experiment. Experiment had 4 different tests, self-created according to the experiment of nonsense syllables from (Ebinghaus 1885). First test had 50 nonsense syllables to lead to the next phase of experiment. Students were separated in 3 groups with almost the same numbers of correct nonsense syllables from the first test. First group was taking the tests without music at all and in silent, second group was doing the test with lyrics music and the third group with relaxing music. All three groups had 5 minutes for each 3 different tests to memorize 50 other nonsense syllables (including 3 same syllables), 12 lines from poems and 50 different order of numbers, then to write down how much they memorized. The music was the same during memorizing phase and was repeated during writing phase with same volume and with headphones on. Result showed that there are significant differences memorizing lines from poems and the same syllables between students without music and them with music. T-test for each group also showed the significant differences between these two groups. Regression analyses explain 33\% of variance factors for memorizing the lines and 50\% of variance factors for memorizing the same syllables, groups have the most impact on regression. Conclusions of this research are that music affects memory negatively resulting that students are able to memorize better without music. This research also concludes that silent is a key factor to recognize the same nonsense syllables. When it comes to memorizing better keep the music down!{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we argue that innovations are instead an emergent property of our species' cultural learning abilities, applied within our societies and social networks. Our societies and social networks act as collective brains. We outline how many human brains, which evolved primarily for the acquisition of culture, together beget a collective brain. Within these collective brains, the three main sources of innovation are serendipity, recombination and incremental improvement. We argue that rates of innovation are heavily influenced by (i) sociality, (ii) transmission fidelity, and (iii) cultural variance. We discuss some of the forces that affect these factors. These factors can also shape each other. For example, we provide preliminary evidence that transmission efficiency is affected by sociality--languages with more speakers are more efficient. We argue that collective brains can make each of their constituent cultural brains more innovative. This perspective sheds light on traits, such as IQ, that have been implicated in innovation. A collective brain perspective can help us understand otherwise puzzling findings in the IQ literature, including group differences, heritability differences and the dramatic increase in IQ test scores over time.},

Comparison of physical and genetic maps reveals variation on a scale of megabases, with substantial differences between sexes. Recombination is often suppressed near centromeres and elevated near telomeres, but neither of these observations is true for all chromosomes. In humans, patterns of linkage disequilibrium and experimental measures of recombination from sperm-typing reveal dramatic hotspots of recombination on a scale of kilobases. Genome-wide variation in the amount of crossing-over may be due to variation in the density of hotspots, the intensity of hotspots, or both. Theoretical models of selection and linkage predict that genetic variation will be reduced in regions of low recombination, and this prediction is supported by data from several species. Heterogeneity in rates of crossing-over provides both an opportunity and a challenge for identifying disease genes: as associations occur in blocks, genomic regions containing disease loci may be identified with relatively few markers, yet identifying the causal mutations is unlikely to be achieved through associations alone.},

  abstract = {In animal communication, sexually selected signals have been shown to often signal individual attributes such as motivation or quality. Birdsong is among the best studied signalling systems, and song traits vary substantially among individuals. The question remains if variation in signalling also reflects more general and consistent individual characteristics. Such consistent individual differences in behaviour that are relatively stable over time and contexts are referred to as personality or behavioural syndromes. Here, we studied the relation between singing and explorative behaviour, a well-studied personality trait, using great tits ( Parus major) under standardized aviary conditions. The results show that singing activity measured as the number of songs sung in spring prior to breeding correlated with male but not with female explorative behaviour. In contrast, song repertoire was not related to explorative behaviour but varied over the day. The link between explorative and singing behaviour suggests that sexually selected signals are more than signals of quality but can also reflect other intrinsic behavioural characteristics such as personality traits.},

  abstract = {Background: Birdsong, a key model in animal communication studies, has been the focus of intensive research. Song traits are commonly considered to reflect differences in individual or territory quality. Yet, few studies have quantified the variability of song traits between versus within individuals (i.e. repeatability), and thus whether certain song traits indeed provide reliable individual-specific information. Here, we studied the dawn chorus of male great tits (Parus major) to determine if key song traits are repeatable over multiple days and during different breeding stages. Additionally, we examined whether repeatability was associated with exploration behaviour, a relevant personality trait. Finally, we tested if variation in song traits could be explained by breeding stage, lowest night temperature, and exploration behaviour. Results: We show that the start time of an individual's dawn song was indeed repeatable within and across breeding stages, and was more repeatable before, than during, their mate's egg laying stage. Males started singing later when the preceding night was colder. Daily repertoire size was repeatable, though to a lesser extent than song start time, and no differences were observed between breeding stages. We did not find evidence for an association between exploration behaviour and variation in dawn song traits. Repertoire composition, and specifically the start song type, varied across days, but tended to differ less than expected by chance. Conclusions: Our findings that individuals consistently differ in key song traits provides a better understanding of the information receivers can obtain when sampling songs of different males. Surprisingly, start time, despite being influenced by a highly variable environmental factor, appeared to be a more reliable signal of individual differences than repertoire size. Against expectation, singers were more repeatable before than during their mate's egg laying stage, possibly because before egg laying, females are less constrained to move around unguarded and thus may then already sample (and compare) different singers. Combining repeated dawn song recordings with spatial tracking could reveal if the sampling strategies of receivers are indeed important drivers of repeatability of song traits. Such a complementary approach will further advance our insights into the dynamics and evolution of animal signalling systems.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {The diversifications of Darwin's finches and Hawaiian honeycreepers are two text-book examples of adaptive radiation in birds. Why these two bird groups radiated while the remaining endemic birds in these two archipelagos exhibit relatively low diversity and disparity remains unexplained. Ecological factors have failed to provide a convincing answer to this phenomenon, and some intrinsic causes connected to craniofacial evolution have been hypothesized. The tight coevolution of the beak and the remainder of the skull in diurnal raptors and parrots suggests that integration may be the prevalent condition in landbirds (Inopinaves). This is in contrast with the archetypal relationship between beak shape and ecology in Darwin's finches and Hawaiian honeycreepers, which suggests that the beak can adapt as a distinct module in these birds. Modularity has therefore been proposed to underpin the adaptive radiation of these groups, allowing the beak to evolve more rapidly and freely in response to ecological opportunity. Here, using geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods in a broad sample of landbird skulls, we show that craniofacial evolution in Darwin's finches and Hawaiian honeycreepers seems to be characterized by a tighter coevolution of the beak and the rest of the skull (cranial integration) than in most landbird lineages, with rapid and extreme morphological evolution of both skull regions along constrained directions of phenotypic space. These patterns are unique among landbirds, including other sympatric island radiations, and therefore counter previous hypotheses by showing that tighter cranial integration, not only modularity, can facilitate evolution along adaptive directions.}

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between depression, anxiety and telomere length, and to assess whether this relationship is moderated by race/ethnicity, gender and/or antidepressant use. Data were from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Telomere length was assessed using the quantitative PCR method of telomere length relative to standard reference DNA. Past-year major depression (MD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD), as well as depressed affect and anxious affect, were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Inventory (N=1290). Multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationship between depression and anxiety disorders and telomere length. Among women, those with GAD or PD had shorter telomeres than those with no anxious affect ({$\beta$}: -0.07, P{$<$}0.01), but there was no relationship among men ({$\beta$}: 0.08, P{$>$}0.05). Among respondents currently taking an antidepressant, those with MD had shorter telomeres than those without ({$\beta$}: -0.26, P{$<$}0.05), but there was no association between MD and telomere length among those not using antidepressants ({$\beta$}: -0.00, P{$>$}0.05). Neither depressive nor anxiety disorders were directly associated with telomere length in young adults. There was suggestive evidence that pharmacologically treated MD is associated with shorter telomere length, likely reflecting the more severe nature of MD that has come to clinical attention.},

Focal observations in 1 year revealed that the most actively singing neighbor was the one the new birds resembled. Songs were not selected on the basis of their absolute acoustic characteristics, but rather by their resemblance to neighbors' songs. After the attrition process is complete, males retain their song for the rest of their lives. Evidence supports the hypothesis that the actual acquisition of a song need not take place at the time and place as males occupy territories. Rather, males may acquire an abundance of song models earlier in life and then select songs from this repertoire that most closely resemble those of their neighbors. The development of mature repertoires and of local dialects is the outcome of one process in this species.},

Previous work using two assays, the production of imitations by adult males and playback-induced calling by young birds during the sensitive phase for memorization, has shown that song birds can discriminate between their own and other species' songs. Herein I use both assays to show that male mountain white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha, must learn to sing but have a genetic predisposition to memorize and learn the songs of their own subspecies. Playback tests to young naive birds before they even begin to sing reveal that birds give begging calls more in response to oriantha song than to songs of another species. After 10 days of tutoring with songs of either their own or another subspecies, birds continue to give stronger call responses to songs of their own sub-species, irrespective of whether they were tutored with them, and are more discriminating in distinguishing between different dialects of their own subspecies. The memory processes that facilitate recognition and discrimination of own-subspecies' song may also mediate the preferential imitation of song of a bird's own subspecies. Such perceptual biases could constrain the direction and rate of cultural evolution of learned songs.},

We first examined two strategies for tutor choice: whether pupils have a conformity bias and/or a preference for high-quality tutors. In keeping with a conformity bias, tutors that sang song types that were relatively common within a radius of about 500~m of their territory were more likely to be imitated than were tutors that sang rarer song types. Most potential tutors were not imitated by pupils. Aspects of tutor quality, such as age, pairing status, and survival to the next year had no effect on whether a tutor's song was imitated. Secondly, we tested whether pupil repertoire size, pupil quality, and local abundance of tutor models affected the accuracy of song imitations. We found a trade-off between repertoire size and tutor imitation accuracy with males that sang two or more song types developing significantly poorer imitations than males that sang one type. We discuss possible functions of a conformity learning strategy and factors that could produce a trade-off between imitation accuracy and repertoire size.},

Certain messages, such as species identification or `alerting' receivers may require a relatively invariant signal structure, while messages about dialect or individual identity and motivation require structural diversity within and among individuals of a species. A resolution to this conflict is to encode different messages in different parts of the signal. When the signal is learned, as in birdsong, parts of the signal may develop along differing developmental pathways in order to produce the necessary signal variation. I tested the hypothesis that three phrases in the song of the Puget Sound white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys pugetensis, that are inferred to convey different messages will vary in their patterns of geographical variation along a 560km long transect of the Pacific northwest coast of North America. I measured acoustic features of the songs of 267 males and tested for geographical structure using Mantel tests and Mantel correlograms. As predicted, the introductory whistle phrase, inferred to have an `alerting' function, was geographically invariant. In contrast, the note complex and trill phrases, which convey information about individual identity and geographical origin, both decreased in similarity between males as distance increased. The two phrases have somewhat independent patterns of geographical variation. I suggest that differences in how these phrases develop, as measured in laboratory song-learning experiments, coupled with dispersal may contribute to the differing distributions.},

Noise pollution puts a severe constraint on vocal communication by interfering with the detection of acoustic signals. Recent studies show that city birds sing higher-frequency songs than their conspecifics in non-urban habitats. This has been interpreted as an adaptation to counteract masking by traffic noise. However, this notion is debated, for the observed frequency shifts seem to be less efficient at mitigating noise than singing louder, and it has been suggested that city birds might use particularly high-frequency song elements because they can be produced at higher amplitudes. Here, we present the first phonetogram for a songbird, which shows that frequency and amplitude are strongly positively correlated in the common blackbird (Turdus merula), a successful urban colonizer. Moreover, city blackbirds preferentially sang higher-frequency elements that can be produced at higher intensities and, at the same time, happen to be less masked in low-frequency traffic noise.},

One approach argues that the affective mechanisms that are dysregulated in depression are adaptations, whilst a second approach argues that depression itself is an adaptation. The evidence relating to whether depression could itself be an adaptation is reviewed. Adaptations generally have four hallmarks; they lack heritable variation, show evidence of good design, are evoked by appropriate triggers, and fitness is reduced where they are absent. Depression shows none of these hallmarks. It is characterized by heritability, recurrence, cognitive impairment, and poor social outcome. In an alternative evolutionary formulation, I argue that evolution has produced a continuous population distribution of affective reactivity that is subject to stabilizing selection. Individuals vulnerable to depression are at the upper end of this distribution. This conceptualization, in which depression itself is not selected for, is compatible with the known clinical and epidemiological facts. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

By contrast, empiricists generally suppose that animals integrate multiple experiences over longer timespans. Here, we compared these two alternative hypotheses by exposing Norway rats to partners that cooperated on three consecutive days but failed to cooperate on the fourth day, and to partners that did the exact opposite. In additional controls, focal rats experienced cooperating and defecting partners only once. In a bar-pulling setup, focal rats based their decision to provide partners with food on last encounters instead of overall cooperation levels. To check whether this might be owing to a lack of memory capacity, we tested whether rats remember the outcome of encounters that had happened three days before. Cooperation was not diminished by the intermediate time interval. We conclude that rats reciprocate help mainly based on most recent encounters instead of integrating social experience over longer timespans.}

Power laws appear widely in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics and finance, computer science, demography and the social sciences. For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, solar flares, moon craters, wars and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws. The origin of power-law behaviour has been a topic of debate in the scientific community for more than a century. Here we review some of the empirical evidence for the existence of power-law forms and the theories proposed to explain them.},

  abstract = {Divergence between the sex chromosomes has led to loss and differentiation of Y-linked genes and haplo-insufficiency for X-linked genes in males. A mechanism of dosage compensation, for which we recently found evidence in mammals, evolved to restore a balanced expression of the genome by doubling the transcriptional output from the X chromosome. X inactivation would then serve to avoid hyper-transcription of X-linked genes in females by silencing one X chromosome. We also found that, compared to the rest of the genome, the X chromosome contains an excess of genes highly expressed in brain tissues. The exceptionally important role of the X chromosome in brain function, evident from the prevalence of X-linked forms of mental retardation, is discussed in view of sex chromosome regulation and evolution and sexual reproduction.}

  abstract = {I am pleased to have this opportunity to offer some reflections on what I have foreseen as an idioms-of-distress research agendum, and some thoughts on what an idioms-of-distress assessment adds to anthropological research on human suffering and culturally informed therapy facilitation in clinical settings. The term idioms of distress has now been in circulation for 30 years and has clearly taken on a life of its own. It was used in DSM IV and is likely to be considered for use in DSM V. A point of discussion in psychiatry at the moment is whether idioms of distress and ''culture syndromes'' are redundant terms or whether they refer to different phenomena. 1 I weigh in on this issue as well as address two critiques of the way the term idioms of distress has been conceptualized by some scholars. I suggest that a distinction among idioms of distress, cultural idioms of distress and cultural syndromes is warranted. And I suggest that the two critiques of idioms of distress reviewed are necessary correctives, returning us to the original intent of an idioms-of-distress agenda. Finally, I highlight a few of the unique contributions made by papers in this issue that push an idioms-of-distress assessment in new and productive directions. In 1977, I wrote a pair of papers laying out an idioms-of-distress research agenda and calling attention to the role practitioners (from diagnosticians to diviners) play in framing experiences and expressions of distress in ways that Obeyesekere (1985, 1990) later came to refer to as the work of culture. 2 My papers were published a few},

It reports a qualitative in-depth interview study of 33 women between the ages of 19 and 60 years (mean age 28.6 years) where the data analysis particularly focused upon their subjective perceptions of what constituted 'normal' sexual satisfaction for themselves and other women. The data comprised taped interviews which were fully transcribed and analysed using an interpretive framework based on both symbolic interactionist and psychodynamic concepts. The results indicated that these women's desires and expectations differed appreciably from those reported in the typical clinical and sexological literature. Women interviewed here seemed less concerned with achieving orgasm through heterosexual intercourse for themselves than the literature suggested they might be. There was however, evidence of a strong desire to experience orgasm in this way for the sake of their male partners. Thus, it is suggested that there is probably a closer relationship between popular beliefs about what is 'normal' based upon the medical model with women placing themselves in a dysfunctional category, than there is between the everyday enjoyment of sex and women identifying themselves as being sexually healthy. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The incidences of the most common sex chromosome abnormalities were Klinefelter syndrome, 1 per 576 boys; XYY, 1 per 851 boys; triple X, 1 per 897 girls; Turner syndrome, 1 per 2130 girls. Follow-up of children with autosomal abnormalities is not included in this study. None of the 78 surviving children with sex chromosome abnormalities was mentally retarded. All children above school age attended regular schools. Seventy-seven percent of Klinefelter, triple X, and XYY children aged 15-19 had received remedial teaching, 29\% were receiving remedial teaching at the last follow-up, 32\% had been in special classes at a regular school due to learning problems, and 24\% were still in such classes at the last time of follow-up. There was no increased frequency of criminal activity or behavior disorders, nor was there any increased frequency of mental or physical disorders. The distribution of planned training or occupation for the 25 youths with sex chromosome abnormalities between 15 and 19 years of age was similar to that of their sibs. Testosterone undecanoate treatment has been given to Klinefelter boys from puberty and growth hormone treatment to Turner girls from the age of 7, and very small doses of estrogen were given to these girls from around the age of 12 when FSH was increasing to postmenopausal levels. Prevention or reduction of deviations in mental development from the normal range in children with sex chromosome abnormalities is possible if educational and social resources are available and the parents are well informed and counseled regularly. Information in Denmark has been given in part by publishing four booklets about triple X, XYY, Turner, and Klinefelter syndrome. Information, support, and stimulation to self-help have, to a certain extent, been given through contact groups. Parents having a child with a sex chromosome abnormality need information, counseling, and assistance. The type and magnitude of this assistance depend on the individual child, the specific sex chromosome abnormality, and the parents' own resources, psychologically, socially, and otherwise.},

  abstract = {Applied ecological research is increasingly inspired by the open science movement. However, new challenges about how we define our science when biodiversity data are being shared and re-used are not solved. Among these challenges is the risk associated with blurring the distinction between research that mainly seeks to explore patterns with no a-priori articulated hypotheses (exploratory research), and research that explicitly tests a-priori formulated hypotheses (confirmatory research). A rapid screening of a random selection of the peer-reviewed literature suggests that neither experimental protocols nor hypothesis-testing sensu stricto are common in applied ecological research. In addition, most experiments are carried out on small spatial scales, which contrast with current global policy needs and research trends towards addressing large spatial and temporal scales. This latter trend makes it unfeasible for policy to rely mainly on insights gained from experimental research. To solve fundamental local, regional and global societal challenges, we need both exploratory and confirmatory research. However, the fundamental roles that confirmatory research testing a-priori hypothesis play in establishing causal relationships need to be revaluated in applied ecological research. A clearer distinction between exploratory and confirmatory research is currently needed, and could be facilitated by allocating journal sections to different types of research; by embracing new tools offered by the open science era, such as pre-registration of hypothesis; by establishing new systems where post-hoc hypotheses emerging through exploration can also be registered for later testing; and by more broad adoption of causal inference methods that foster more structured testing of hypotheses about causal mechanisms from observational biodiversity data. Synthesis and applications. To gain the full benefits of the open science era, researchers, funding bodies and journal editors should explicitly consider approaches and incentives that encourage openness about methods and approaches, as well as value the plurality of scientific approaches needed to address questions in applied ecology and conservation science.},

Pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) and premen-strual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) comprise both psychological (disturban-ces in mood and affect) and physiological (bloating and changes in appetite) symp-toms that may trigger binge-eating and/ or purging. Method: Female participants were drawn from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiological Surveys, conducted from 2001 to 2003. Weighted multivariable logistic regression modeled the associa-tion between lifetime PMS and PMDD and lifetime odds of BN or BED. Results: Among 8,694 participants, 133 (1.0\%) had BN and 185 (1.8\%) BED. Addi-tionally, 366 (4.2\%) had PMDD and 3,489 (42.4\%) had PMS. Prevalence of PMDD and PMS were 17.4 and 55.4\% among those with BN, 10.7 and 48.9\% among those with BED and 3.4 and 59.1\% among those with subthreshold BED. After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, income, education, body mass index, age at menarche, birth control use, and comorbid mental health conditions, PMDD was associated with seven times the odds of BN (OR 7.2, 95\% CI 2.3, 22.4) and PMS with two times the odds of BN (OR 2.5, 95\% CI 1.1, 5.7). Neither PMDD nor PMS were significantly associated with BED. Discussion: Women with PMS and PMDD have a higher odds of BN, inde-pendent of comorbid mental health con-ditions. PMS and PMDD may be important comorbidities to BN to con-sider in clinical settings, and future research should investigate whether PMS and PMDD affect the onset and duration of bulimic symptoms as well as the potential for shared risk factors across dis-orders.},

Experiential time is perceived to be continuous by our senses but there is a limit to this temporal reproduction. Durations longer than a minute need external devices to be known. The Maya calendars manifest known time and they were and still are designed to order the days, i.e. the passing of time. The calendars have been created from cognitive interaction with digits, aging, pregnancy, vegetative cycles, the sun and phases of the moon, the hydrological cycle, i.e. from objects and the events they generated. Once established these calendars have also affected the way time has been perceived individually and collectively. With the collapse of the institution of divine kingship during the 9\textendash 11th centuries AD, the accumulative time of the Long Count disappeared in favor of the cyclical Short Count. This change implies not just sociopolitical changes but also cognitive changes.

The process through which birds and humans learn many of their vocalizations as well as the underlying neural system exhibit a number of striking parallels and have been widely researched. In contrast, rhythm, a key feature of language, and music, has received surprisingly little attention in songbirds. Investigating temporal periodicity in bird song has the potential to inform the relationship between neural mechanisms and behavioral output and can also provide insight into the biology and evolution of musicality. Here we present a method to analyze birdsong for an underlying rhythmic regularity. Using the intervals from one note onset to the next as input, we found for each bird an isochronous sequence of time stamps, a "signal-derived pulse," or pulseS, of which a subset aligned with all note onsets of the bird's song. Fourier analysis corroborated these results. To determine whether this finding was just a byproduct of the duration of notes and intervals typical for zebra finches but not dependent on the individual duration of elements and the sequence in which they are sung, we compared natural songs to models of artificial songs. Note onsets of natural song deviated from the pulseS significantly less than those of artificial songs with randomized note and gap durations. Thus, male zebra finch song has the regularity required for a listener to extract a perceived pulse (pulseP), as yet untested. Strikingly, in our study, pulsesS that best fit note onsets often also coincided with the transitions between sub-note elements within complex notes, corresponding to neuromuscular gestures. Gesture durations often equaled one or more pulseS periods. This suggests that gesture duration constitutes the basic element of the temporal hierarchy of zebra finch song rhythm, an interesting parallel to the hierarchically structured components of regular rhythms in human music.},

  abstract = {We have traced central nervous pathways controlling bird son in the canary using a combination of behavioral and anatomical techniques. Unilateral electrolytic brain lesions were made in adult male canaries whose son had been previously recorded and analysed on a sound spectrograph. After severral days of postoperative recording, the birds were sacrificed and their brains processed histologically for degeneration staining with the Fink-Heimer technique. Although large lesions in the neostriatum and rostral hyperstriatum had no effect on song, severe song deficits followed damage to a discrete large-celled area in the caudal hyperstriatum ventrale (HVc). Degenerating fibers were traced from this region to two other discrete nuclei in the forebrain: one in the parolfactory lobe (area X, a teardrop-shaped small-celled nucleus) and a round large-celled nucleus in the archistriatum (RA). Unilateral lesions of X had no effect on song; lesions of RA, however, caused severe song deficits. Degenerating fibers from RA joined the occipitomesencephalic tract and had widespread ipsilateral projections to the thalamus, nucleus intercollicularis of the midbrain, reticular formation, and medulla. It is of particular interest that direct connections were found onto the cells of the motor nucleus innervating the syrinx, the organ of song production. Unilateral lesions of n. intercollicularis (previously implicated in the control of vocal behavior) had little effect on song. One bilateral lesion of HVc resulted in permanent (9 months) and complete elimination of the audible components of song, although the bird assumed the posture and movements typical of song. Preliminary data suggest that lesions of the left hemisphere result in greater deficits than lesions of the right one. This finding is consistent with earlier reports that the left syrinx controls the majority of song components. Results reported here suggest a localization of vocal control in the canary brain with an overlying left hemispheric dominance.

  abstract = {SYNOPSIS. The developmental processes through which songbirds acquire their species\textemdash typical songs have been well\textemdash studied from a proximate perspective, but less attention has been given to the ultimate question of why birds learn to sing. We present a new hypothesis for the adaptive significance of song learning in songbirds, suggesting that this specialized form of vocal development provides an indicator mechanism by which females can accurately assess the quality of potential mates. This hypothesis expands on the established idea that song can provide an indicator of male quality, but it explicitly links the variation in song expression that females use to choose mates to the developmental processes through which song is acquired. How well a male sings\textemdash reflected in repertoire size or in other learned features of a male's singing behavior\textemdash provides an honest indicator of quality because the timing of song learning and, more importantly, the timing of the development of brain structures mediating learning corresponds to a period in development during which young songbirds are most likely to undergo nutritional stress. This correspondence means that song learning can provide a sensitive indicator of early developmental history in general, which in turn reflects various aspects of the phenotypic and genotypic quality of a potential mate.},

  abstract = {Closely related species of songbirds often show large differences in song syntax, suggesting that major innovations in syntax must sometimes arise and spread. Here we examine the response of male and female swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana, to an innovation in song syntax produced by males of this species. Young male swamp sparrows that have been exposed to tutor songs with experimentally increased trill rates reproduce these songs with periodic silent gaps (Podos 1996, Animal Behaviour, 51, 1061-1070). This novel temporal pattern, termed 'broken syntax', has been demonstrated to transmit across generations (Podos et al. 1999, Animal Behaviour, 58, 93-103). We show here that adult male swamp sparrows respond more strongly in territorial playback tests to songs with broken syntax than to heterospecific songs, and equally strongly to conspecific songs with normal and broken syntax. In tests using the solicitation display assay, adult female swamp sparrows respond more to broken syntax than to heterospecific songs, although they respond significantly less to conspecific songs with broken syntax than to those with normal syntax. We conclude that sexual selection by female choice is in this case conservative, acting against the spread of innovation. The conservative effect of female preferences must sometimes be overcome, however, to allow the evolution of the major structural differences in song observed between species. \textcopyright{} 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Prior work has demonstrated that males who are deprived of the opportunity to learn produce songs that function little if at all in male-female interactions. We asked whether more subtle variation in male song-learning abilities influences female response to song. Using a copulation solicitation assay, we measured the response of female song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to songs of laboratory-reared males that differed in the amount of learned versus invented material that they included and in the degree to which learned material accurately matched the model from which it was copied. Females responded significantly more to songs that had been learned better, by either measure. Females did not discriminate between the best-learned songs of laboratory-reared males and songs of wild males used as models during learning. These results provide, to our knowledge, a first experimental demonstration that variation in learning abilities among males plays a functionally important part in the expression of a sexually selected trait, and further provide support for the hypothesis that song functions as an indicator of male quality because it reflects variation in response to early developmental stress.},

  abstract = {The nutritional stress hypothesis explains how learned features of song, such as complexity and local dialect structure, can serve as indicators of male quality of interest to females in mate choice. The link between song and quality comes about because the brain structures underlying song learning largely develop during the first few months post-hatching. During this same period, songbirds are likely to be subject to nutritional and other stresses. Only individuals faring well in the face of stress are able to invest the resources in brain development necessary to optimize song learning. Learned features of song thus become reliable indicators of male quality, with reliability maintained by the developmental costs of song. We review the background and assumptions of the nutritional stress hypothesis, and present new experimental data demonstrating an effect of nestling nutrition on nestling growth, brain development, and song learning, providing support for a key prediction of the hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Cultural traits spread via multiple mechanisms among individuals within social groups, including via transmission biases that occur when subordinates copy from dominants (prestige transmission), or via common cultural trait variants that are favoured over rare ones (consensus transmission). Most animal populations are subdivided into social groups where cultural learning occurs, yet theoretical studies of cultural trait transmission have tended to focus on within-group transmission dynamics. We developed an agent-based model of cultural transmission in socially structured populations in which a trait arises in one individual and either persists until a stable population equilibrium is reached, or goes extinct. With this model, we systematically varied group size, rates of dispersal among groups, mortality rates, transmission characteristics, the benefit of the cultural trait (including possibly negative benefits), and whether individuals disperse locally or randomly. We used generalized linear models to examine how changes in these parameters influence trait extinction, equilibrium prevalence and time to equilibrium. Four traits increased the probability of extinction: smaller group size, higher background mortality, lower transmission rate and more costly traits (although costly traits sometimes reached an equilibrium). Local dispersal and biased transmission mechanisms (prestige and consensus) had no significant effects on extinction probability, and similar patterns were found for equilibrium prevalence. We found that a lower dispersal rate and local dispersal slowed the time required for a trait to reach equilibrium, as did smaller groups, lower transmission rates and lower costs. Collectively, these analyses reveal that prestige and consensus transmission have weaker effects than other factors associated with demographic and social conditions. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

The importance of model choice continues to grow as phylogenetic models continue to increase in complexity to better capture micro and macroevolutionary processes. In a Bayesian framework, the marginal likelihood is how data update our prior beliefs about models, which gives us an intuitive measure of comparing model fit that is grounded in probability theory. Given the rapid increase in the number and complexity of phylogenetic models, methods for approximating marginal likelihoods are increasingly important. Here we try to provide an intuitive description of marginal likelihoods and why they are important in Bayesian model testing. We also categorize and review methods for estimating marginal likelihoods of phylogenetic models, highlighting several recent methods that provide well-behaved estimates. Furthermore, we review some empirical studies that demonstrate how marginal likelihoods can be used to learn about models of evolution from biological data. We discuss promising alternatives that can complement marginal likelihoods for Bayesian model choice, including posterior-predictive methods. Using simulations, we find one alternative method based on approximate-Bayesian computation (ABC) to be biased. We conclude by discussing the challenges of Bayesian model choice and future directions that promise to improve the approximation of marginal likelihoods and Bayesian phylogenetics as a whole.},

Thus, bird song has become a textbook example of the power of sexual selection to lead to extreme neurological and behavioural sex differences. Here we present an extensive survey and ancestral state reconstruction of female song across songbirds showing that female song is present in 71\% of surveyed species including 32 families, and that females sang in the common ancestor of modern songbirds. Our results reverse classical assumptions about the evolution of song and sex differences in birds. The challenge now is to identify whether sexual selection alone or broader processes, such as social or natural selection, best explain the evolution of elaborate traits in both sexes. \textcopyright{} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Bird song has traditionally been studied as an elaborate male trait, but female song is also widespread in both temperate and tropical species and likely evolved in the early ancestors of modern songbirds. However, female song is underrepresented in biological collections compared to male song, and we lack documentation of female songs for most songbird species. Better documentation of female bird song is necessary for an understanding of the prevalence, regulation, function, evolution, and conservation applications of avian vocalizations. Therefore, we call on all researchers to disseminate their observations of female bird song, and to spread the word among other researchers, students, field technicians, and citizen scientists that many female songbirds sing. To this end, we provide resources for disseminating recordings and written documentation of female song, including best practices for documentation, venues for archiving and publishing, and our citizen science project, the Female Bird Song Project. We especially appeal to researchers studying marked populations who can accurately assess sex-specific singing behavior. Documenting female song across many species and geographic regions is a major endeavor. By working collectively, we can make the greatest progress toward applying the resultant knowledge to a wide variety of fields.},

Despite this striking assumption, many recent studies have sought to assess whether neutrality can provide a good description of different episodes of cultural change. One approach has been to test whether neutral predictions are consistent with observed progeny distributions, recording the number of variants that have produced a given number of new instances within a specified time interval: a classic example is the distribution of baby names. Using an overlapping generations model, we show that these distributions consist of two phases: a power-law phase with a constant exponent of , followed by an exponential cut-off for variants with very large numbers of progeny. Maximum-likelihood estimations of the model parameters provide a direct way to establish whether observed empirical patterns are consistent with neutral evolution. We apply our approach to a complete dataset of baby names from Australia. Crucially, we show that analyses based on only the most popular variants, as is often the case in studies of cultural evolution, can provide misleading evidence for underlying transmission hypotheses. While neutrality provides a plausible description of progeny distributions of abundant variants, rare variants deviate from neutrality. Further, we develop a simulation framework that allows the detection of alternative cultural transmission processes. We show that anti-novelty bias is able to replicate the complete progeny distribution of the Australian dataset.},

Bengalese songs are composed of multiple chunks of song notes, and each chunk is a combination of 2-5 song notes. Furthermore, chunks are arranged in a finite-state probabilistic automaton. We studied how and why BFs sing such complex songs. We found the following: (1) ancestral strains sing simpler songs; (2) there is high learning specificity in white-rumped munias but not in BFs; (3) BFs have larger song control nuclei and higher glutamate receptor gene expression levels than white-rumped munias; (4) both BFs and white-rumped munia females prefer complex songs as measured by the nest string assay, and males with complex songs are physically fitter than males with simpler songs. These results indicated the sexual selection scenario of song complexity in Bengalese finches. We further examined factors related to domestication. We examined songs of white-rumped munias in subpopulations of Taiwan. Where there is a sympatric species with white-rumped munias, songs were simpler. This led to a hypothesis that in the wild, songs needed to be simple to secure species identification, but under domestication this constraint was unnecessary. Based on these results, we extended our research into the socio-emotional domain. All indexes suggested that white-rumped munias have higher levels of stress and social shyness, which should be adaptive in natural environments, but could limit opportunities for learning complex songs. Evolution of song complexity involves factors related to the strength of sexual selection and relaxation of species identification as well as socio-emotional factors because of domestication. The results of the present study on BFs should be useful in discussing the possible biological origins of human speech relating to proximate and ultimate factors.},

For language to be a vehicle of thought, protolanguage must develop a degree of complexity that allows for the syntactic manipulation of symbol sequences. Thus, before language emerged, a process in which signals became complex must have occurred. Here, we submit a scenario describing the process in which courtship songs gained in complexity during the course of domestication of Bengalese finches. By comparing domesticated Bengalese finches with their wild strain, white-rumped munias, we found that female preferences for complex songs were coupled with domesticated relaxed environments to give rise to song complexity. Furthermore, we found that the outcomes of domestication in Bengalese finches include decreased psychological and physiological stress reactions, decreased aggressiveness, and changed plumage colors. These characteristics are consistent with ``domestication syndrome,'' originally proposed for mammals but now possibly applicable to birds. Our finding that domestication was a cause of signal complexity might be helpful in considering the process of signal evolution in human language.},

We envision secondary contact between two neighboring populations with different song dialects. An individual's ability to learn song is confined by a genetic predisposition: if predispositions are strong, there will be no phenotypic overlap in song between populations, whereas weak predispositions allow phenotypic overlap, or "mixed" song. To determine if reinforcement has occurred, we consider if an allele for within-population female mating preference, based on song, can spread, and whether population specific songs can concurrently be maintained at equilibrium. We model several scenarios, including costs to mating preferences, mating preferences in hybrids, and hybrids having the ability to learn pure songs. We find that when weak predispositions are fixed within a population reinforcement based on song cannot occur. However, when some individuals have strong predispositions, restricting phenotypic overlap between populations in the trait, reinforcement is only slightly inhibited from a purely genetic model. Generalizing beyond the example of song, we conclude that socially learned signals will tend to prohibit reinforcement, but it may still occur if some individuals acquire trait phenotypes genetically. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Individual acoustic monitoring (IAM), based on the analysis of vocal cues, is particularly suitable for the identification and tracking of birds with temporally stable song or call characteristics. Unlike mark-recapture methods, IAM does not require the physical manipulation of individuals, which can have long-lasting behavioural effects. So far, IAM has usually focused on males, as singing females tend to be overlooked in temperate zones. Here, we evaluated the suitability of IAM for both sexes in an isolated population of the Tawny Pipit (Anthus campestris, Motacillidae), a migratory Palearctic species critically endangered in Central Europe, for which female singing has been occasionally documented. We confirmed that songs of all 101 studied individuals, both males and females, were individually distinct. Most individuals used only a single song type in their repertoires, with only three males using two. Of 45 ringed males (that could be unambiguously recognized visually), only two changed their song structure to some extent, either within or between seasons. Multiple individuals often sang structurally similar song types, which nevertheless consistently differed in minor characteristics; such differences were detectable by visual inspection and also affected quantitative analyses of song similarity. Songs sung by females did not have any apparent sex-specific characteristics. Unlike previously suggested, females did not adapt their vocalization to their breeding partner, and we presume their song is also temporally stable. Our findings support IAM as a reliable approach for studying the behaviour and ecology of this passerine species with a small repertoire and simple songs.},

Yet, informal comparisons among phylogenetically independent taxonomic groups seem to cast doubt on the putative role of social factors in the evolution of complex communication. Here, we provide a formal test of the sociality hypothesis alongside alternative explanations for the evolution of communicative complexity. We compiled data documenting variations in signal complexity among closely related species for several case study groups--ants, frogs, lizards and birds--and used new phylogenetic methods to investigate the factors underlying communication evolution. Social factors were only implicated in the evolution of complex visual signals in lizards. Ecology, and to some degree allometry, were most likely explanations for complexity in the vocal signals of frogs (ecology) and birds (ecology and allometry). There was some evidence for adaptive evolution in the pheromone complexity of ants, although no compelling selection pressure was identified. For most taxa, phylogenetic null models were consistently ranked above adaptive models and, for some taxa, signal complexity seems to have accumulated in species via incremental or random changes over long periods of evolutionary time. Becoming social presumably leads to the origin of social communication in animals, but its subsequent influence on the trajectory of signal evolution has been neither clear-cut nor general among taxonomic groups.},

Furthermore, by comparing the expert data with a reanalysis of nonexpert data collected in a previous, but identical study, we propose as a first approximation that musical expertise dissolves the relationship between liking and complexity.},

  abstract = {In songbirds, male song is an acoustic signal used to attract mates and defend territories. Typically, song is an acoustically complex signal; however, the fee-bee song of the black-capped chickadee is relatively simple. Despite this relative simplicity, two previous studies (Christie et al., 2004b; Hoeschele et al., 2010) found acoustic features within the fee-bee song that contain information regarding an individual's dominance rank; however each of these studies reported a different dominance-related acoustic cue. Specifically, the relative amplitude of the two notes differed between the songs of dominant and subordinate males from northern British Columbia, while the interval pitch ratio differed between the songs of dominant and subordinate males from eastern Ontario. In the current study, we examined six acoustic features within songs from both of the chickadee populations (northern British Columbia and eastern Ontario) examined in these previ- ous studies and used bioacoustic analyses and discriminant function analyses to determine whether there is a consistent dominance-related acoustic cue across both, or in each of these populations. Consistent with the previous findings, the current results indicate that relative amplitude differs based on dominance status in the songs from British Columbia; however, our results failed to reach significance with songs from Ontario. These results suggest that acoustic cues that signal a male's dominance in this species vary with geographic location. Furthermore, examining songs from these two locations and one additional location in northern British Columbia, we found that discriminant function analyses could correctly classify songs based on geographic location. Considering the broad extent of the species' range, black-capped chickadee song is considered relatively invariant; however, our results suggest that there is geographic variation in songs, although the differences are subtle compared to geographic song variation in other species. \textcopyright{} 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

  abstract = {Hypotheses on regional song variation (``dialects'') assume that dialects remain stable within regions, are distinct between regions, and persist within populations over extensive periods [1\textendash 3]. Theories to explain dialects focus on mechanisms that promote persistence of regional song variants despite gene flow between regions [4\textendash 6], such as juveniles settling in non-natal populations retaining only those songs from their repertoires that match neighbors [7, 8]. It would be considered atypical for a novel song variant to invade and replace the established regional variant. Yet some studies have reported song variants shifting rapidly over time within populations [9\textendash 11]. White-throated sparrows, Zonotrichia albicolis, for example, traditionally sing a whistled song terminating in a repeated triplet of notes [12], which was the ubiquitous variant in surveys across Canada in the 1960s [13]. However, doublet-ending songs emerged and replaced triplet-ending songs west of the Rocky Mountains sometime between 1960 and 2000 [11] and appeared just east of the Rockies in the 2000s [14]. From recordings collected over two decades across North America, we show that doublet-ending song has now spread at a continental scale. Using geolocator tracking, we confirm that birds from western Canada, where doublet-ending songs originated, overwinter with birds from central Canada, where the song initially spread. This suggests a potential mechanism for spread through song tutoring on wintering grounds. Where the new song variant has spread, it rose from a rare variant to the sole, regional song type, as predicted by the indirect biased transmission hypothesis [10]. Video Abstract: [Figure presented] Otter et al. study the cultural evolution of song variants in white-throated sparrows. Using songs of nearly 1,800 males recorded between 2000 and 2019, Otter et al. show the progressive adoption of one song variant (doublet-ending song) by males starting in western Canada and sweeping over 3,000 km eastward to replace the traditional triplet-ending songs.},

However, only partial effects have been reported for candidate genes experimentally tested so far. Here we demonstrate that inactivation of two ovarian somatic factors, Wnt4 and Foxl2, produces testis differentiation in XX mice, resulting in the formation of testis tubules and spermatogonia. These genes are thus required to initiate or maintain all major aspects of female sex determination in mammals. The two genes are independently expressed and show complementary roles in ovary morphogenesis. In addition, forced expression of Foxl2 impairs testis tubule differentiation in XY transgenic mice, and germ cell-depleted XX mice lacking Foxl2 and harboring a Kit mutation undergo partial female-to-male sex reversal. The results are all consistent with an anti-testis role for Foxl2. The data suggest that the relative autonomy of the action of Foxl2, Wnt4 and additional ovarian factor(s) in the mouse should facilitate the dissection of their respective contributions to female sex determination.},

Since then, we have found several more capuchin populations in savanna-like environments which employ this form of tool use.5-7 The evidence so far only weakly supports genetically based behavioral differences between populations and does not suggest that dietary pressures in poor environments are proximate determinants of the likelihood of tool use. Instead, tool use within these capuchin populations seems to be a behavioral tradition that is socially learned and is primarily associated with more terrestrial habits. However, differences in the diversity of "tool kits" between populations remain to be understood.},

  abstract = {Long-distance migratory animals must contend with global climate change, but they differ greatly in whether and how they adjust. Species that socially learn their migration routes may have an advantage in this process compared to other species, as learned changes that are passed on to the next generation can speed up adjustment. However, evidence from the wild that social learning helps migrants adjust to environmental change is absent. Here, we study the behavioral processes by which barnacle geese (\emph{Branta leucopsis}) adjust spring-staging site choice along the Norwegian coast, which appears to be a response to climate change and population growth. We compared individual-based models to an empirical description of geese colonizing a new staging site in the 1990s. The data included 43 years of estimated annual food conditions and goose numbers at both staging sites (1975\textendash 2017), as well as annual age-dependent switching events between the two staging sites from one year to the next (2000\textendash 2017). Using Approximate Bayesian Computation, we assessed the relative likelihood of models with different "decision rules", which define how individuals choose a staging site. In the best performing model, individuals traveled in groups and staging site choice was made by the oldest group member. Groups normally returned to the same staging site each year, but exhibited a higher probability of switching staging site in years with larger numbers of geese at the staging site. The decision did not depend on food availability in the current year. Switching rates between staging sites decreased with age, which was best explained by a higher probability of switching between groups by younger geese, and not by young geese being more responsive to current conditions. We found no evidence that the experienced foraging conditions in previous years affected staging site choice. Our findings demonstrate that copying behavior and density-dependent group decisions explain how geese adjust their migratory habits rapidly in response to changes in food availability and competition. We conclude that considering social processes can be essential to understand how migratory animals respond to changing environments.}

The terminal taxa of the ring (major and minor sectors) are supposed to be reproductively isolated in a zone of secondary contact in the middle Amur valley, Siberia. Our study combines molecular markers (cytochrome-b), bioacoustic analyses and morphological characters to judge the ring species status of the great tit complex. Despite a notable percentage of intermediately coloured birds in the mixed population of middle Amur, a lack of mitochondrial introgression between the major and minor sectors and a small number of true hybrids among voucher specimens from this area suggest at least a partial reproductive barrier between both sectors. In contrast, variation of morphological and especially acoustic characters along the ring-shaped area and the phylogenetic structure of the P. major group do not match the ring species concept. Bioacoustic and molecular data (cytochrome-b sequences) reveal two large and closely related subspecies blocks, the sectors major and bokharensis in the Western Palaearctic and central Asia, and the sectors minor and cinereus in the Eastern Palaearctic and South-east Asia, respectively. The two western sectors diverged only recently (0.5 Mya) and they were separated from the eastern group by Pleistocene events about 1.5 Mya. Songs from allopatric regions of the two subspecies blocks differ distinctly in frequency parameters and element composition. In the area of secondary contact, males of all phenotypes share the same frequency range of song, close to the range of the typical minor song. Hybrids and major males sing mixed repertoires of typical major and minor strophe types as well as mixed strophes. In contrast, phenotypic minor males display only pure minor strophes. Differences in mate choice and mating success based on repertoire size are believed to uphold the reproductive barrier between major and minor birds in the area of sympatry. Taxonomic consequences suggest three separate species in the Parus major complex: Parus major s.s.

  abstract = {Vocal learning has evolved several times independently in mammals and three major orders of birds. Of these only hummingbirds and passerine birds have complex songs, whereas the large vocal repertoires of parrots comprise various call types associated with different behavioral contexts. Generally, bird song has two major functions: territorial defense and mate attraction. In the latter context, particularly in songbirds (Oscines), the evolution of male song repertoires has strongly been driven by sexual selection: Song complexity and repertoire size have been shown to be indicators of male quality and are thus crucial traits for female choice. Today, the age of phylogenetics provides new methods for the study of the mode and tempo of organismic diversification and of trait evolution, e.g., of vocal learning. As a striking result, song learning seems to be associated with species richness across the avian tree of life. This provided recent evidence for the theory that song learning can act as a pacemaker of evolution. The spatial variation of song dialects is often correlated with genetic diversification. Extreme cases are small isolated populations, for example, on islands. In the field, the effect of song diversification as a barrier for gene flow can best be observed in zones of secondary contact between close relatives. Even in cases of hybridization, differences of song might affect female choice and thus lead to assortative mating and prevent gene flow in one or even in both directions. These are probably the most exciting case studies, where speciation in action (or in reverse) can be studied in the wild.},

We test this hypothesis by investigating fertility, mortality, health, and overall reproductive success in Agta hunter-gatherers whose camps exhibit variable levels of sedentarization, mobility, and involvement in agricultural activities. We conducted blood composition tests in 345 Agta and found that viral and helminthic infections as well as child mortality rates were significantly increased with sedentarization. Nonetheless, both age-controlled fertility and overall reproductive success were positively affected by sedentarization and participation in cultivation. Thus, we provide the first empirical evidence, to our knowledge, of an adaptive mechanism in foragers that reconciles the decline in health and child survival with the observed demographic expansion during the Neolithic.},

Sensory experience with a song 'tutor' during this sensitive period prunes excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the song production nucleus HVC (proper noun). Neurons in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), a secondary auditory region, lose their tutor-song selectivity upon blocking gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling. Given the importance of inhibition in the song learning process, we investigated whether individual differences in learning outcomes can be explained by the distribution of specific populations of (mostly) inhibitory neurons in the NCM and HVC. We measured the densities of distinct neuronal populations (defined by their expression of the calcium-binding proteins Calbindin, Calretinin, and Parvalbumin) in these two regions. We found that lateralization of Calbindin-positive neurons was related to successful song learning: good learners were characterized by hemispheric asymmetry of Calbindin-positive neurons in the medial NCM (fewer CB+ neurons in the left hemisphere), whereas poor learners did not show any asymmetry. In contrast, the density of all three neuronal populations in HVC did not differ between good and poor learners. These findings not only identify a specific (presumably) inhibitory cell type (Calbindin-expressing neurons) that is related to song learning, but also emphasize the role of hemispheric asymmetry in auditory memory formation.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}In humans and songbirds, neuronal activation for language and song shifts from bilateral- or diffuse-activation to left-hemispheric dominance while proficiency increases. Further parallels exist at the behavioural level: unstructured juvenile vocalizations become highly stereotyped adult vocalizations through a process of trial and error learning. Greater left-hemispheric dominance in the songbird caudomedial Nidopallium (NCM), a Wernicke-like region, is related to better imitation of the tutor's song learned early in development, indicating a role for left NCM in forming auditory memories. Here, we hypothesize that inhibition of the left NCM during interaction with a song tutor would impair imitation of the tutor's song more than inhibition of the right NCM. We infused a transient sodium channel blocker (TTX) immediately prior to tutoring sessions in either left or right auditory lobule of previously isolated juvenile male zebra finches ({$<$}em{$>$}Taeniopygia guttata{$<$}/em{$>$}). Upon maturation, both right-infused and left-infused birds tutor-song imitation was significantly impaired. Left-infused birds also showed less consistency in the rhythmic stability of their song as well as increased pitch, suggesting a subtle division of function between the left and right auditory lobules.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  author = {Panteli, Maria},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {The comparison of world music cultures has been considered in musicological research since the end of the 19th century. Traditional methods from the field of comparative musicology typically involve the process of manual music annotation. While this provides expert knowledge, the manual input is timeconsuming and limits the potential for large-scale research. This thesis considers computational methods for the analysis and comparison of world music cultures. In particular, Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tools are developed for processing sound recordings, and data mining methods are considered to study similarity relationships in world music corpora. MIR tools have been widely used for the study of (mainly) Western music. The first part of this thesis focuses on assessing the suitability of audio descriptors for the study of similarity in world music corpora. An evaluation strategy is designed to capture challenges in the automatic processing of world music recordings and different state-of-the-art descriptors are assessed. Following this evaluation, three approaches to audio feature extraction are considered, each addressing a different research question. First, a study of singing style similarity is presented. Singing is one of the most common forms of musical expression and it has played an important role in the oral transmission of world music. Hand-designed pitch descriptors are used to model aspects of the singing voice and clustering methods reveal singing style similarities in world music. Second, a study on music dissimilarity is performed. While musical exchange is evident in the history of world music it might be possible that some music cultures have resisted external musical influence. Low-level audio features are combined with machine learning methods to find music examples that stand out in a world music corpus, and geographical patterns are examined. The last study models music similarity using descriptors learned automatically with deep neural networks. It focuses on identifying music examples that appear to be similar in their audio content but share no (obvious) geographical or cultural links in their metadata. Unexpected similarities modelled in this way uncover possible hidden links between world music cultures. This research investigates whether automatic computational analysis can uncover meaningful similarities between recordings of world music. Applications derive musicological insights from one of the largest world music corpora studied so far. Computational analysis as proposed in this thesis advances the state-of-the-art in the study of world music and expands the knowledge and understanding of musical exchange in the world.},

  abstract = {Comparative phylogeographical studies in island archipelagos can reveal lineage-specific differential responses to the geological and climatic history. We analysed patterns of genetic diversity in six codistributed lineages of darkling beetles (Tenebrionidae) in the central Aegean archipelago which differ in wing development and habitat preferences. A total of 600 specimens from 30 islands and eight adjacent mainland regions were sequenced for mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and nuclear Muscular protein 20. Individual gene genealogies were assessed for the presence of groups that obey an independent coalescent process using a mixed Yule coalescent model. The six focal taxa differed greatly in the number of coalescent groups and depth of lineage subdivision, which was closely mirrored by the degree of geographical structuring. The most severe subdivision at both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA level was found in flightless lineages associated with presumed stable compact-soil habitats (phrygana, maquis), in contrast to sand-obligate lineages inhabiting ephemeral coastal areas that displayed greater homogeneity across the archipelago. A winged lineage, although associated with stable habitats, showed no significant phylogenetic or geographical structuring. Patterns of nucleotide diversity and local genetic differentiation, as measured using {$\Phi$}ST and hierarchical amova, were consistent with high levels of ongoing gene flow in the winged taxon; frequent local extinction and island recolonisation for flightless sand-obligate taxa; and very low gene flow and geographical structure largely defined by the palaeogeographical history of the region in flightless compact-soil taxa. These results show that differences in dispersal rate, mediated by habitat persistence, greatly influence the levels of phylogeographical subdivision in lineages that are otherwise subjected to the same geological events and palaeoclimatic changes.},

This body of work has the potential to help us move towards a general understanding of factors driving divergence in signal recognition. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 57 playback studies to explain variation in strength of response to local versus foreign songs. Studies with incomplete reporting of results had elevated effects due to selective reporting. Studies that used small numbers of stimuli as exemplars (pseudoreplication) had more variable effects than studies without severe pseudoreplication. Whether or not we controlled for pseudoreplication, we found greater response to playback of local song than to foreign song. In investigating potential biological drivers of the variation in strength of experimental effects, we found that the difference in territorial response to local versus foreign song was stronger if the foreign song was recorded from another subspecies than if the foreign song was recorded from the same subspecies as the focal individuals. Indexes of risk of accidental response to heterospecific song did not coherently explain response to foreign conspecific songs, nor did factors expected to influence individual experience with foreign conspecific songs. Thus, although oscine songbirds clearly react more aggressively to local song than to foreign song and variation in the strength of this effect is influenced by methodological choices and subspecies status, considerable variation in the strength of response to local versus foreign song playback remains to be explained.},

Each trial began at a random point in the rhythmic cycle. Listeners were asked to tap along with the underlying beat or pulse. The number of times a given pulse (period, phase) was selected was taken as a measure of its perceptual salience. Responses gravitated toward a moderate pulse period of about 700 ms. At faster tempi, taps coincided more often with events followed by longer interonset intervals. In Experiment 2, listeners heard the same set of rhythmic patterns, plus a single sound in a different timbre, and were asked whether the extra sound fell on or off the beat. The position of the downbeat was found to be quite ambiguous. A quantitative model was developed from the following assumptions. The phenomenal accent of an event depends on the interonset interval that follows it, saturating for interonset intervals greater than about 1 s. The salience of a pulse sensation depends on the number of events matching a hypothetical isochronous template, and on the period of the template\textemdash pulse sensations are most salient in the vicinity of roughly 100 events per minute (moderate tempo). The metrical accent of an event depends on the saliences of pulse sensations including that event. Calculated pulse saliences and metrical accents according to the model agree well with experimental results (r {$>$} 0.85). The model may be extended to cover perceived meter, perceptible subdivisions of a beat, categorical perception, expressive timing, temporal precision and discrimination, and primacy/recency effects. The sensation of pulse may be the essential factor distinguishing musical rhythm from nonrhythm.},

Although the existence of two taxonomic groups has been suggested by some studies, the species has presented taxonomic difficulties in classification in previous studies. UMAP exhibited a clearer separation of groups than previously used dimensionality-reduction techniques (i.e., principal component analysis), as it was able to effectively identify the two taxa groups. The results achieved with UMAP in this study suggest that the technique can be useful in the analysis of species with complex in taxonomy through vocalizations data as a complementary tool including behavioral traits such as acoustic communication.}

While current models of cultural shifts usually require a major exogenous or endogenous change, we propose that the mechanism underlying many paradigm shifts may just be an emergent feature of the inherent congruence among different cultural traits. We implement this idea through a population dynamics model in which individuals are defined by a vector of cultural traits that changes mainly through cultural contagion, biased by a 'cultural fitness' landscape, between contemporary individuals. Cultural traits reinforce or hinder each other (through a form of cultural epistasis) to prevent cognitive dissonance. Our main result is that abrupt paradigm shifts occur, in response to weak changes in the landscape, only in the presence of epistasis between cultural traits, and regardless of whether horizontal transmission is biased by homophily. A relevant consequence of this dynamics is the irreversible nature of paradigm shifts: the old paradigm cannot be restored even if the external changes are undone. Our model puts the phenomenon of paradigm shifts in cultural evolution in the same category as catastrophic shifts in ecology or phase transitions in physics, where minute causes lead to major collective changes.}

Most studies showed an association between indicators of poverty and the risk of mental disorders, the most consistent association being with low levels of education. A review of articles exploring the mechanism of the relationship suggested weak evidence to support a specific association with income levels. Factors such as the experience of insecurity and hopelessness, rapid social change and the risks of violence and physical ill-health may explain the greater vulnerability of the poor to common mental disorders. The direct and indirect costs of mental ill-health worsen the economic condition, setting up a vicious cycle of poverty and mental disorder. Common mental disorders need to be placed alongside other diseases associated with poverty by policy-makers and donors. Programmes such as investment in education and provision of microcredit may have unanticipated benefits in reducing the risk of mental disorders. Secondary prevention must focus on strengthening the ability of primary care services to provide effective treatment.},

  abstract = {Understanding causes of variation in promiscuity within populations remain a major challenge. While most studies have focused on quantifying fitness costs and benefits of promiscuous behaviour, an alternative possibility\textemdash that variation in promiscuity within populations is maintained because of linkage with other traits\textemdash has received little attention. Here, we examine whether promiscuity in male and female great tits (Parus major)\textemdash quantified as extra-pair paternity (EPP) within and between nests\textemdash is associated with variation in a well-documented personality trait: exploration behaviour in a novel environment. Exploration behaviour has been shown to correlate with activity levels, risk-taking and boldness, and these are behaviours that may plausibly influence EPP. Exploration behaviour correlated positively with paternity gained outside the social pair among males in our population, but there was also a negative correlation with paternity in the social nest. Hence, while variation in male personality predicted the relative importance of paternity gain within and outside the pair bond, total paternity gained was unrelated to exploration behaviour. We found evidence that males paired with bold females were more likely to sire extra-pair young. Our data thus demonstrate a link between personality and promiscuity, with no net effects on reproductive success, suggesting personality-dependent mating tactics, in contrast with traditional adaptive explanations for promiscuity.},

In a Bayesian framework, perceptual estimates from sensory information are combined with prior knowledge, with a stronger influence of the prior when the sensory evidence is less certain. Here, we explored the behavioral and neural consequences of manipulating stimulus certainty in the context of orientation processing. First, we asked partic-ipants to judge whether a stimulus was oriented closer to vertical or the clockwise primary oblique (45\textdegree ) for two stimulus types (spatially filtered noise textures and sinusoidal gratings) and three manipulations of certainty (orientation bandwidth, contrast, and duration). We found that participants consistently had a bias toward reporting orientation as closer to 45\textdegree{} during conditions of high certainty and that this bias was reduced when sensory evidence was less certain. Second, we measured event-related fMRI BOLD responses in human primary visual cortex (V1) and manipulated certainty via stimulus contrast (100\% vs 3\%). We then trained a multivariate classifier on the pattern of responses in V1 to cardinal and primary oblique orientations. We found that the classifier showed a bias toward classifying orientation as oblique at high contrast but categorized a wider range of orientations as cardinal for low-contrast stimuli. Orientation classification based on data from V1 thus paralleled the perceptual biases revealed through the behavioral experiments. This pattern of bias cannot be explained simply by a prior for cardinal orientations.},

  abstract = {Human infants are capable of accurately matching facial gestures of an experimenter within a few hours after birth, a phenomenon called neonatal imitation. Recent studies have suggested that rather than being a simple reflexive-like behavior, infants exert active control over imitative responses and `provoke' previously imitated gestures even after a delay of up to 24 h. Delayed imitation is regarded as the hallmark of a sophisticated capacity to control and flexibly engage in affective communication and has been described as an indicator of innate protoconversational readiness. However, we are not the only primates to exhibit neonatal imitation, and delayed imitation abilities may not be uniquely human. Here we report that 1-week-old infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) who show immediate imitation of a lipsmacking gesture also show delayed imitation of lipsmacking, facilitated by a tendency to refrain from lipsmacking toward a still face during baseline measurements. Individual differences in delayed imitation suggest that differentially matured cortical mechanisms may be involved, allowing some newborns macaques to actively participate in communicative exchanges from birth. Macaque infants are endowed with basic social competencies of intersubjective communication that indicate cognitive and emotional commonality between humans and macaques, which may have evolved to nurture an affective mother-infant relationship in primates.},

  abstract = {Neonatal imitation is the matching of (often facial) gestures by newborn infants. Some studies suggest that performance of facial gestures is due to general arousal, which may produce false positives on neonatal imitation assessments. Here we examine whether arousal is linked to facial gesturing in newborn infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). We tested 163 infants in a neonatal imitation paradigm in their first postnatal week and analyzed their lipsmacking gestures (a rapid opening and closing of the mouth), tongue protrusion gestures, and yawn responses (a measure of arousal). Arousal increased during dynamic stimulus presentation compared to the static baseline across all conditions, and arousal was higher in the facial gestures conditions than the nonsocial control condition. However, even after controlling for arousal, we found a condition-specific increase in facial gestures in infants who matched lipsmacking and tongue protrusion gestures. Thus, we found no support for the arousal hypothesis. Consistent with reports in human newborns, imitators' propensity to match facial gestures is based on abilities that go beyond mere arousal. We discuss optimal testing conditions to minimize potentially confounding effects of arousal on measurements of neonatal imitation.},

  abstract = {The effects of population decline on culturally transmitted behaviours in animals have rarely been described, but may have major implications to population viability. Learned vocal signals in birds are of critical importance to behaviours associated with reproduction, intrasexual interactions and group cohesion, and the complexity of vocal signals such as song can serve as an honest signal of an individual's quality as well as the viability of a population. In this study, we examined how rapid population declines recently experienced by Hawaiian honeycreepers on the island of Kaua`i (USA) may have influenced the diversity, complexity and similarity of learned honeycreeper songs. We analysed the acoustic characteristics of songs recorded during three time periods over a 40-year time frame for three species of declining Kaua`i honeycreepers. We detected a loss of song complexity and diversity over the 40-year time period that paralleled dramatic population declines. Concurrent with the loss of complexity, we also found that the acoustic characteristics of the three honeycreepers' songs became more similar to one another. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of convergence of acoustic characteristics among rapidly declining species. The reduction in song complexity and diversity and convergence of songs not only signals a loss of culturally transmitted behaviours in these endemic Hawaiian honeycreepers, but also potential challenges to the recovery of these rapidly declining species. Moreover, the present study highlights that there is a `hidden' cost to declining populations beyond just the loss of individuals that is not often considered, the loss of culturally transmitted social behaviours.},

Four hypotheses of the mechanisms responsible for the mimics' success were tested in the field. Song matching among neighbours was not involved with recognition of local demes or with assortative mating; the population structure of song neighbourhoods is open and songs are not signals of kinship or community. Song matching was not directed towards females in sexual mimicry, and females rarely switched from an old mate to a younger one with the same song. Song mimicry was not directed towards the neighbouring male whose song was copied, as he was no less aggressive towards a song mimic than towards non-mimics. Song mimicry was associated with the timing of territorial establishment and of associated dispersal and residence in the first-year males. Four out of six predictions of a hypothesis of intraspecific competitive mimicry among male buntings were realized. The results best fit the hypothesis that a male that mimics the song of an older neighbour may deceive his territorial competitors, the other first-year males, in mistaken individual recognition.},

The complexity of the task stems not just from the macroevolutionary and macroecological challenge of modelling so many species, but also from the difficulty in collecting and quantifying birdsong itself. Using machine learning techniques, we extracted songs from a large citizen science dataset, and then analysed the evolution, and biotic and abiotic predictors of variation in birdsong across 578 passerine species. Contrary to expectations, we found few links between life-history traits (monogamy and sexual dimorphism) and the evolution of song pitch (peak frequency) or song complexity (standard deviation of frequency). However, we found significant support for morphological constraints on birdsong, as reflected in a negative correlation between bird size and song pitch. We also found that broad-scale biogeographical and climate factors such as net primary productivity, temperature, and regional species richness were significantly associated with both the evolution and present-day distribution of bird song features. Our analysis integrates comparative and spatial modelling with newly developed data cleaning and curation tools, and suggests that evolutionary history, morphology, and present-day ecological processes shape the distribution of song diversity in these charismatic and important birds.},

  abstract = {A key feature of speech is the quasi-regular rhythmic information contained in its slow amplitude modulations. In this article we review the information conveyed by speech rhythm, and the role of ongoing brain oscillations in listeners' processing of this content. Our starting point is the fact that speech is inherently temporal, and that rhythmic information conveyed by the amplitude envelope contains important markers for place and manner of articulation, segmental information, and speech rate. Behavioral studies demonstrate that amplitude envelope information is relied upon by listeners and plays a key role in speech intelligibility. Extending behavioral findings, data from neuroimaging\textemdash particularly electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)\textemdash point to phase locking by ongoing cortical oscillations to low-frequency information (\textasciitilde 4\textendash 8 Hz) in the speech envelope. This phase modulation effectively encodes a prediction of when important events (such as stressed syllables) are likely to occur, and acts to increase sensitivity to these relevant acoustic cues. We suggest a framework through which such neural entrainment to speech rhythm can explain effects of speech rate on word and on segment perception (i.e., that the perception of phonemes and words in connected speech are influenced by preceding speech rate). Neuroanatomically, acoustic amplitude modulations are processed largely bilaterally in auditory cortex, with intelligible speech resulting in additional recruitment of left hemisphere regions. Notable among these is lateral anterior temporal cortex, which we propose functions in a domain-general fashion to support ongoing memory and integration of meaningful input. Together, the reviewed evidence suggests that low frequency oscillations in the acoustic speech signal form the foundation of a rhythmic hierarchy supporting spoken language, mirrored by phase-locked oscillations in the human brain.},

Existing association studies have largely used simple landmark-distances as surrogates for the complex morphological phenotypes of the face. However, this can result in decreased statistical power and unclear inference of shape changes. In this study, we applied a new image registration approach that automatically identified the salient landmarks and aligned the sample faces using high density pixel points. Based on this high density registration, three different phenotype data schemes were used to test the association between the common facial morphological variation and 10 candidate SNPs, and their performances were compared. The first scheme used traditional landmark-distances; the second relied on the geometric analysis of 15 landmarks and the third used geometric analysis of a dense registration of {$\sim$}30,000 3D points. We found that the two geometric approaches were highly consistent in their detection of morphological changes. The geometric method using dense registration further demonstrated superiority in the fine inference of shape changes and 3D face modeling. Several candidate SNPs showed potential associations with different facial features. In particular, one SNP, a known risk factor of non-syndromic cleft lips/palates, rs642961 in the IRF6 gene, was validated to strongly predict normal lip shape variation in female Han Chinese. This study further demonstrated that dense face registration may substantially improve the detection and characterization of genetic association in common facial variation.},

In this work we quantify these two notions in terms of instrumentation and production technologies that are typically involved in crafting popular music.

Some of these studies controlled only for the familiarity of the stimuli, while others relied on pleasantness ratings, and others still on musical preferences. With a listening test and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, we wished to clarify the role of familiarity in the brain correlates of music appreciation by controlling, in the same study, for both familiarity and musical preferences. First, we conducted a listening test, in which participants rated the familiarity and liking of song excerpts from the pop/rock repertoire, allowing us to select a personalized set of stimuli per subject. Then, we used a passive listening paradigm in fMRI to study music appreciation in a naturalistic condition with increased ecological value. Brain activation data revealed that broad emotion-related limbic and paralimbic regions as well as the reward circuitry were significantly more active for familiar relative to unfamiliar music. Smaller regions in the cingulate cortex and frontal lobe, including the motor cortex and Broca's area, were found to be more active in response to liked music when compared to disliked one. Hence, familiarity seems to be a crucial factor in making the listeners emotionally engaged with music, as revealed by fMRI data.},

Here we provide new genomic sequence (\textasciitilde 8 Mb) from 186 primates representing 61 (\textasciitilde 90\%) of the described genera, and we include outgroup species from Dermoptera, Scandentia, and Lagomorpha. The resultant phylogeny is exceptionally robust and illuminates events in primate evolution from ancient to recent, clarifying numerous taxonomic controversies and providing new data on human evolution. Ongoing speciation, reticulate evolution, ancient relic lineages, unequal rates of evolution, and disparate distributions of insertions/deletions among the reconstructed primate lineages are uncovered. Our resolution of the primate phylogeny provides an essential evolutionary framework with far-reaching applications including: human selection and adaptation, global emergence of zoonotic diseases, mammalian comparative genomics, primate taxonomy, and conservation of endangered species.},

However, there is increasing evidence that humans are born with musical predispositions that develop spontaneously into sophisticated knowledge bases and procedures that are unique to music. Recent findings also suggest that the brain is equipped with music-specific neural networks and that these can be selectively compromised by a congenital anomaly. This results in a disorder, congenital amusia, that appears to be limited to the processing of music. Recent evidence points to fine-grained perception of pitch as the root of musical handicap. Hence, musical abilities appear to depend crucially on the fine-tuning of pitch, in much the same way that language abilities rely on fine time resolution.},

Its influence on nocturnal and dawn bird behaviour is known, but fewer studies have examined its effect on passerines' singing activity, some of which have yielded contradictory findings. With the aim of elucidating whether moon phase affects dawn singing in passerines, we recorded dawn singing activity of the Dupont's Lark {$<$}em class="EmphasisTypeItalic"{$>$}Chersophilus duponti{$<$}/em{$>$} in three mediterranean shrub-steppes, through repeated sampling over three lunar cycles per breeding season in 2~years. Our results corroborate the idea that moon phase affects signalling behaviour of passerines. We found that, on average, dawn singing started 15~min earlier when the moon was full, due to variations in the light intensity, which seems to act as a trigger for singing activity in the Dupont's Lark. Nonetheless, the dawn chorus finished at the same time regardless of moon phase, maybe due to a low contribution of moonlight as sunrise approaches. As a consequence, performance time increased during full moon nights. However, the total production of songs did not differ between moon phases, and therefore, song rate was lower during full moons. Reduced song rate on full moon nights could be a response of singing males to reduce their predation risk, since singing on bright nights can increase the ability of predators to locate them, but it could be also related to the energetic cost of longer choruses. The consequences of moon phase for mate attraction, reproductive success and behaviour in this and other bird species remain unknown, and thus our research can serve as a starting point from which to develop new studies.}

In this work, we studied aboriginal populations from southern South America, the last continental region peopled by humans and with a wide range of ecological conditions. Because of these characteristics, southern South America provides a unique opportunity to study the relative importance of random and nonrandom factors in human diversification. Previous craniometric studies recognized remarkable differences among populations from this region, usually resorting to random factors as the main explanation. In contrast, here we suggest, using tests based on quantitative genetic models, that: (1) the rate of craniofacial divergence among these populations is too high and (2) the patterns of variation within and between populations are too different to be explained by genetic drift alone. In addition, the among-sample craniofacial variation is correlated with climate and diet but not with mtDNA variation. We suggest that the influence of nonrandom factors (e.g., plasticity, selection) on human craniofacial diversification in regions with large ecological variation is more important than generally acknowledged and capable to generate large craniofacial divergence in a short period of time. These results bring nonrandom factors into focus for the interpretation of human craniofacial variation.},

We artificially constrain our access to data to a small subset of the ImageNet dataset, and compare each data augmentation technique in turn. One of the more successful data augmentations strategies is the traditional transformations mentioned above. We also experiment with GANs to generate images of different styles. Finally, we propose a method to allow a neural net to learn augmentations that best improve the classifier, which we call neural augmentation. We discuss the successes and shortcomings of this method on various datasets.},

We revisit these findings and show that when certain assumptions about the relationship between language and the world are abandoned, learners will converge to languages that depend on the structure of the world as well as their prior biases. These theoretical results are supported with a series of experiments showing that when human learners acquire language through iterated learning, the ultimate structure of those languages is shaped by the structure of the meanings to be communicated. \textcopyright{} 2014 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.},

Ongoing uncertainty about the integrity and role of global processing in autism gives special importance to the question of how autistic individuals group local stimulus attributes into meaningful spatial patterns. We investigated visual grouping in autism by measuring sensitivity to mirror symmetry, a highly-salient perceptual image attribute preceding object recognition. Autistic and non-autistic individuals were asked to detect mirror symmetry oriented along vertical, oblique, and horizontal axes. Both groups performed best when the axis was vertical, but across all randomly-presented axis orientations, autistics were significantly more sensitive to symmetry than non-autistics. We suggest that under some circumstances, autistic individuals can take advantage of parallel access to local and global information. In other words, autistics may sometimes see the forest and the trees, and may therefore extract from noisy environments genuine regularities which elude non-autistic observers.},

Like many elasmobranchs, manta rays are highly mobile and wide-ranging species threatened by anthropogenic impacts. In shallow water environments, these pelagic rays often form groups and perform several apparently socially mediated behaviors. Group structures may result from active choices of individual rays to interact or passive processes. Social behavior is known to affect spatial ecology in other elasmobranchs, but this is the first study providing quantitative evidence for structured social relationships in manta rays. To construct social networks, we collected data from more than 500 groups of reef manta rays ({$<$}em class="EmphasisTypeItalic"{$>$}Mobula alfredi{$<$}/em{$>$}) over 5~years in the Raja Ampat Regency of West Papua. We used generalized affiliation indices to isolate social preferences from non-social associations, the first study on elasmobranchs to use this method. Longer lasting social preferences were detected mostly between female rays. We detected assortment of social relations by phenotype and variation in social strategies, with the overall social network divided into two main communities. Overall network structure was characteristic of a dynamic fission-fusion society, with differentiated relationships linked to strong fidelity to cleaning station sites. Our results suggest that fine-scale conservation measures will be useful in protecting social groups of {$<$}em class="EmphasisTypeItalic"{$>$}M. alfredi{$<$}/em{$>$} in their natural habitats and that a more complete understanding of the social nature of manta rays will help predict population responses to anthropogenic pressures, such as increasing disturbance from dive tourism.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}h3 class="Heading"{$>$}Significance statement{$<$}/h3{$><$}p class="Para"{$>$}In social animals, relationships between individuals have important implications for species conservation.

We show for the first time that individual manta rays have preferred relationships with others that are maintained over time, and structured societies.

A mixed method design, consisting of multiple regression analyses of 257 questionnaires, and qualitative analysis of two contrasting case studies, was utilized. Externalized self-perception, silencing the self, and divided self subscales of the Silencing the Self Scale (STSS) were significantly related to premenstrual distress, and externalized self-perception, divided self and care as self-sacrifice subscales significantly related to premenstrual coping. In conjunction with the case study accounts of self-silencing, this confirms previous research findings that women with PMS use hegemonic constructions of femininity against which to judge themselves, and repress feelings and behaviours which deviate from these ideals, or attribute them to the reproductive body. Accounts of the intersubjective negotiation of PMS and of reactions to premenstrual distress reinforced previous suggestions that partners play a crucial role in women's experience of premenstrual change. Levels of anxiety were significantly higher than non-clinical population norms. However, levels of depression were lower than both population norms and previous reports of depression in women with similar STSS scores. This is interpreted as women with PMS directing their anger outwards once a month, rather than internalizing it and becoming depressed.},

Most traits involved in sexual display, however, seem unlikely to have any inherent relationship with cognition beyond that which arises through the effect of cognitive abilities on acquisition of resources and, in turn, the effect of resources on development of the display trait. In contrast, for displays whose development and expression require learning, a direct link with cognition is possible because of a shared dependence on brain function. The parallel effects of developmental stress on song-learning and cognition provide a compelling explanation for an association between attributes of the song and cognitive ability. We outline the hypothesis that sexually selected qualities of song serve as an indicator of cognitive abilities. We first present evidence that song-learning is itself a challenging cognitive task. We then give evidence that sexual selection favors well-learned song. Next, we review evidence that song and cognitive ability both are affected by developmental stresses. We consider recent experimental data testing the relationship between song and cognitive ability. Finally, we suggest that the accuracy with which songs are learned may be an optimal indicator of other cognitive abilities.},

  abstract = {Most songbirds learn their songs through imitation. However, what a male sings as an adult is not necessarily a complete inventory of what he memorized at some earlier point in time: songbirds commonly memorize more material than they eventually sing as adults. Work with swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana, first confirmed that males rehearse many of the song models to which they are exposed during the sensory phase of song acquisition but subsequently include only a subset of those rehearsed songs in their adult repertoire. This process of overproduction and selective attrition has since been demonstrated in other species as well. More recently, the persistent memory of tutor songs rehearsed but not included in the adult repertoire has been demonstrated at the neural level. Furthermore, memories of song models heard during the sensory phase of acquisition but never detected during rehearsal in the sensorimotor phase also may persist into adulthood. Here we review behavioural and neural studies of overproduction and attrition in song learning. We discuss factors that may trigger the persistence of some models and the rejection of others in an individual's repertoire and possible functional consequences of this phenomenon. Data from human speech research indicates that humans also may unconsciously retain memories of features of languages heard early in life but never spoken.},

  abstract = {In social animals, kin relations strongly shape the social structure of a group. In female-bonded species, maternal relatedness is likely to be mediated via familiarity, but evidence is accumulating that non-human primates are able to recognize kin that they are not familiar with and adjust their behavior accordingly. In playback experiments, female rhesus macaques showed increased interest in `coo' calls produced by unfamiliar paternal half-sisters compared to `coo' calls produced by unfamiliar unrelated females, suggesting that these calls should have some common structural characteristics that facilitate the discrimination of kin from non-kin. Here we analyzed `coo' calls of 67 adult female rhesus macaques from four groups and seven matrilines living on the island of Cayo Santiago (Puerto Rico). We tested whether the call structure of closely maternal and/or paternal related females, as determined from extensive pedigree data, differed from the call structure of unrelated females, while controlling for familiarity (i.e., group-matrilineal membership and age difference) of subjects. In contrast to our expectation, kinship did not predict similarities in `coo' call structure, whereas `coo' structure was more similar when produced by females of similar age as well as by females with higher familiarity, suggesting that experience is more decisive than genetic background. The high number of individuals in the analysis and the high accuracy of the assignment of calls to individuals render a lack of power as an unlikely explanation. Thus, based on the results of this study, kin recognition in rhesus monkeys does neither appear to be based on the assessment of self-similarity, nor on the comparison among related subjects (i.e., acoustic phenotype matching), but appears to be mediated by different or multiple cues. Furthermore, the results support the notion that frequent social interactions result in increasing acoustic similarity within largely innate call types (`vocal accommodation').},

Such theories are predicated on pre-tunable instruments, and yet the voice is almost certainly the original musical instrument. Therefore, the analysis of vocal scales offers a more naturalistic approach to understanding the origin of musical scales. In the present study, we conducted a large-scale computational analysis of vocal pitch-class properties and their implications for scale structure. We analyzed 418 field recordings of solo, unaccompanied songs from across 10 principal musical-style regions of the world. The results revealed a mean vocal pitch-class imprecision of approximately 1.5 semitones, and comparable results were obtained across all regions. These results suggest that vocal imprecision is universal and is mainly derived from the physiological limitations of the voice. Such vocal imprecision fundamentally constrains the formation of musical scale structure: it provides a lower limit on the spacing between adjacent scale tones and thus an upper limit on the number of scale tones that an octave can contain. We discuss these results in terms of an Interval Spacing model of the evolution of musical scales.},

Similarly to allele frequencies in population genetics, observing frequencies of birdsong features can improve our understanding of cultural transmission and evolution. Uniquely, community-science databases of birdsong provide rich spatiotemporal data with untapped potential to evaluate cultural evolution in songbirds. Here we use both community-science and field-study recordings of chipping sparrows to examine trends across nearly seven decades of song. We find that some syllable types tend to persist in the population for much longer than others. Persistent songs tend to contain more syllables of shorter duration than songs which were observed across fewer years. To draw inferences about the effects of learning biases on chipping sparrow syllables, we construct a spatially explicit agent-based model of song learning. By comparing our empirical analysis to simulated song distributions using three different song-learning strategies\textemdash neutral transmission, conformity bias, and directional selection\textemdash we suggest that chipping sparrows are unlikely to select tutors neutrally or with a conformity bias and that they learn their songs with a remarkably low copy-error rate.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Clinically and biologically, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is heterogeneous. Unusual patterns of visual preference as indexed by eye tracking are hallmarks; however, whether they can be used to define an early biomarker of ASD as a whole or leveraged to define a subtype is unclear. To begin to examine this issue, large cohorts are required.  METHODS A sample of 334 toddlers from six distinct groups (115 toddlers with ASD, 20 toddlers with ASD features, 57 toddlers with developmental delay, 53 toddlers with other conditions [e.g., premature birth, prenatal drug exposure], 64 toddlers with typical development, and 25 unaffected toddlers with siblings with ASD) was studied. Toddlers watched a movie containing geometric and social images. Fixation duration and number of saccades within each area of interest and validation statistics for this independent sample were computed. Next, to maximize power, data from our previous study (n = 110) were added for a total of 444 subjects. A subset of toddlers repeated the eye-tracking procedure.  RESULTS As in the original study, a subset of toddlers with ASD fixated on geometric images {$>$}69\% of the time. Using this cutoff, sensitivity for ASD was 21\%, specificity was 98\%, and positive predictive value was 86\%. Toddlers with ASD who strongly preferred geometric images had 1) worse cognitive, language, and social skills relative to toddlers with ASD who strongly preferred social images and 2) fewer saccades when viewing geometric images. Unaffected siblings of ASD probands did not show evidence of heightened preference for geometric images. Test-retest reliability was good. Examination of age effects suggested that this test may not be appropriate with children {$>$}4 years old.  CONCLUSIONS Enhanced visual preference for geometric repetition may be an early developmental biomarker of an ASD subtype with more severe symptoms.},

Five studies (\emph{n}\,=\,34,442) show that attributing poverty to situational forces is associated with greater concern about inequality, preference for egalitarian policies and inequality-reducing behaviour. In Study\,1, situational attributions for poverty were associated with reduced support for inequality across 34\,countries. Study\,2 replicated these findings with a nationally representative sample of Americans. Three experiments then tested whether situational attributions for poverty are malleable and motivate egalitarianism. Bolstering situational attributions for poverty through a writing exercise (Study\,3) and a computer-based poverty simulation (Studies\,4a and b) increased egalitarian action and reduced support for inequality immediately (Studies\,3 and 4b), 1\,d later and 155\,d post-intervention (Study\,4b). Causal attributions for poverty offer one accessible means of shaping inequality-reducing attitudes and actions. Situational attributions may be a potent psychological lever for lessening societal inequality.}

Here, we investigate this possibility in the nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) by manipulating the number of demonstrator fish at two feeders, one rich and one poor, during a demonstration phase and evaluating how this affects the likelihood that the focal fish copy the demonstrators' apparent choices. As predicted, we observed a significantly increased level of copying with increasing numbers of demonstrators at the richer of the two feeders, with copying increasing disproportionately, rather than linearly, with the proportion of demonstrators at the rich foraging patch. Control conditions with non-feeding demonstrators showed that this was not simply the result of a preference for shoaling with larger groups, implying that nine-spined sticklebacks copy in a conformist manner. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Royal Society.},

The method of textual criticism (ecdotics, i.e., the building of text-version genealogies) created by French philologist Henri Quentin (1872?1935) proposes the use of a type of branching scheme equivalent to unrooted trees in phylogenetics. Because Quentin's method has never become the prevailing paradigm in philology, his insight into unrooted trees has not been noticed in previous studies comparing philology and phylogenetics. In fact, the modern use of unrooted trees in philology is seen as imported from phylogenetics. Quentin's procedure starts by building an unrooted tree (`chain') expressing the network of text versions (taxa) based on `variants' (equivalent to unpolarized character states). Such undirected scheme is then rooted on the basis of extrinsic temporal information, thus resulting in a complete (rooted) hypothesis of relationships. Quentin asserts that the building of an unrooted tree precedes the determination of its orientation (rooting) and that the two procedures reflect distinct levels of structural organization, relying on different assumptions. Henri Quentin fully grasped the implications of time-reversible properties of unrooted trees and associated characters, in striking prescience of the same concepts developed in phylogenetics some 45 years later. The two versions of unrooted trees were developed entirely independently of each other and such convergence is testimony to the formal efficiency of approaching historical reconstruction in unrooted and rooted dimensions.

  abstract = {Biological invasions are not only events with substantial environmental and socioeconomic impacts but are also interesting natural experiments, allowing the study of phenomena such as the cultural evolution of bird song following introduction. We took an excellent opportunity to compare the distribution of dialects of the yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, a small Eurasian passerine, in its native source region (Great Britain) and invaded range (New Zealand) more than hundred years after relocation. Recent field recordings (including those provided by volunteers within a citizen science project) were complemented by those from archives, each assigned to appropriate dialect by visual inspection of a sonogram, and the resulting spatial patterns of dialect distribution were interpreted using historical data on the yellowhammer invasion. The two countries differ markedly in the composition and distribution of dialects. New Zealand populations sing a greater number of different dialects, seven in total, five of which were not detected in the current British population, but have been reported by previous studies from the continental Europe. Two identified localities of capture (Brighton, Sussex, UK) and release (Dunedin, Otago, NZ) differ even more strikingly, having no dialects in common. The largely sedentary nature of yellowhammers allows for two mutually exclusive explanations for European dialects being detected in New Zealand but not in Great Britain: 1) the corresponding song types have emerged de novo in New Zealand, through convergent cultural evolution; 2) the dialects have disappeared from Great Britain, while being preserved in New Zealand. Indirect evidence from the widespread occurrence of these dialects in continental Europe and the reported stability of yellowhammer song, supports the latter explanation. We suggest that the yellowhammer dialect system is an avian equivalent of a phenomenon already noted in human languages, in which ancient words or structures are retained in expatriate communities.},

  abstract = {Background In many gregarious mammals, mothers and offspring have developed the abilities to recognise each other using acoustic signals. Such capacity may develop at different rates after birth/parturition, varying between species and between the participants, i.e., mothers and young. Differences in selective pressures between species, and between mothers and offspring, are likely to drive the timing of the onset of mother-young recognition. We tested the ability of Australian sea lion mothers to identify their offspring by vocalisation, and examined the onset of this behaviour in these females. We hypothesise that a rapid onset of recognition may reflect an adaptation to a colonial lifestyle. Principal Findings In a playback study maternal responses to own pup and non-filial vocalisations were compared at 12, 24 and every subsequent 24 hours until the females' first departure post-partum. Mothers showed a clear ability to recognise their pup's voice by 48 hours of age. At 24 hours mothers called more, at 48 hours they called sooner and at 72 hours they looked sooner in response to their own pup's vocalisations compared to those of non-filial pups. Conclusions We demonstrate that Australian sea lion females can vocally identify offspring within two days of birth and before mothers leave to forage post-partum. We suggest that this rapid onset is a result of selection pressures imposed by a colonial lifestyle and may be seen in other colonial vertebrates. This is the first demonstration of the timing of the onset of maternal vocal recognition in a pinniped species.},

  abstract = {Objective: To compare, prospectively, 4 different schemes of antibiotic prophylaxis previously to transrectal prostate biopsy. Materials and Methods: 257 patients were randomized in 4 groups: Group I: single dose of ciprofloxacin 2 hours before the procedure; Group II: ciprofloxacin 3 days; Group III: chloramphenicol 3 days; and Group IV: norfloxacin 3 days. The complication rate was assessed in a blind way on the third and on the thirtieth days through a questionnaire. Groups were compared by the qui-square method and, in small samples, by the Fisher method, with statistical significance of 95\%. Results: Complications index throughout the sample differed between the 4 groups of patients under study, being 3.1\% for group I, 2.1\% for group II, 18.3\% for group III and 10.5\% for group IV. Schemes employing ciprofloxacin were statistically superior to those that used norfloxacin or chloramphenicol (p {$<$} 0.05). There was no difference between a single dose and 3 days of ciprofloxacin (p {$>$} 0.05). Conclusion: Schemes using ciprofloxacin presented better results in prophylaxis previously to prostate biopsy. We recommend using a single dose of ciprofloxacin due to its posologic ease and low cost, associated with a therapeutic response equivalent to 3-day regimens.},

  abstract = {Many bird species, especially song birds but also for instance some hummingbirds and parrots, have noted dialects. By this we mean that locally a particular song is sung by the majority of the birds, but that neighbouring patches may feature different song types. Behavioural ecologists have been interested in how such dialects come about and how they are maintained for over 45 years. As a result, a great deal is known about different mechanisms at play, such as dispersal, assortative mating and learning of songs, and there are several competing hypotheses to explain the dialect patterns known in nature. There is, however, surprisingly little theoretical work testing these different hypotheses at present. We analyse the simplest kind of model that takes into account the most important biological mechanisms, and in which one may speak of dialects: a model in which there are but two patches, and two song types. It teaches us that a combination of little dispersal and strong assortative mating ensures dialects are maintained. Assuming a simple, linear frequency-dependent learning rule has little effect on the maintenance of dialects. A nonlinear learning rule, however, has dramatic consequences and greatly facilitates dialect maintenance. Adding fitness benefits for singing particular songs in a given patch also has a great impact. Now rare song types may invade and remain in the population. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {There is a recent proposal to apply convex hulls to the measurement of habitat filtering, trophic diversity and functional richness. Although this approach has successful applications, some conceptual difficulties with the interpretation of results should not be overlooked. The basic assumption that trait convergence and the associated deflation of the convex hull is a result of environmental (habitat) filtering does not always hold, because 1 ) some traits may converge as a result of competition as well, and 2) environmental factors, such as disturbance, may lead to divergence, rather than convergence for certain characters. There is neither evidence nor theoretical proof that increasing correlations between traits and reduction in trait combinations are always caused by habitat filtering, especially when individual trait ranges are unchanged. Diversity measurements in terms of convex hull volumes may be misleading because zero or near zero values may result no matter how wide the individual trait ranges are. For these reasons, applications of convex hulls cannot be viewed uncritically, and considerable care must be taken even if the method is used in combination with other techniques.},

According to classical theories of speciation, mating signals diversify, in part, as an incidental byproduct of adaptation by natural selection to divergent ecologies2,3, although empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis has been limited4,6. Here I show, in Darwin's finches of the Gal\'apagos Islands, that diversification of beak morphology and body size has shaped patterns of vocal signal evolution, such that birds with large beaks and body sizes have evolved songs with comparatively low rates of syllable repetition and narrow frequency bandwidths. The converse is true for small birds. Patterns of correlated evolution among morphology and song are consistent with the hypothesis that beak morphology constrains vocal evolution, with different beak morphologies differentially limiting a bird's ability to modulate vocal tract configurations during song production. These data illustrate how morphological adaptation may drive signal evolution and reproductive isolation, and furthermore identify a possible cause for rapid speciation in Darwin's finches.},

  abstract = {Recent studies of vocal mechanics in songbirds have identified a functional role for the beak in sound production. The vocal tract (trachea and beak) filters harmonic overtones from sounds produced by the syrinx, and birds can fine-tune vocal tract resonance properties through changes in beak gape. In this study, we examine patterns of beak gape during song production in seven species of Darwin's finches of the Galapagos Islands. Our principal goals were to characterize the relationship between beak gape and vocal frequency during song production and to explore the possible influence therein of diversity in beak morphology and body size. Birds were audio and video recorded (at 30 frames s-1) as they sang in the field, and 164 song sequences were analyzed. We found that song frequency regressed significantly and positively on beak gape for 38 of 56 individuals and for all seven species examined. This finding provides broad support for a resonance model of vocal tract function in Darwin's finches. Comparison among species revealed significant variation in regression y-intercept values. Body size correlated negatively with y-intercept values, although not at a statistically significant level. We failed to detect variation in regression slopes among finch species, although the regression slopes of Darwin's finch and two North American sparrow species were found to differ. Analysis within one species (Geospiza fortis) revealed significant inter-individual variation in regression parameters; these parameters did not correlate with song frequency features or plumage scores. Our results suggest that patterns of beak use during song production were conserved during the Darwin's finch adaptive radiation, despite the evolution of substantial variation in beak morphology and body size.},

  abstract = {Our goal in this chapter has been to evaluate, from both empirical and conceptual perspectives, the factors that facilitate the evolution of geographic variation in bird vocalizations. Studies on this topic have traditionally focused on the evolution of song "dialects," and have emphasized functional hypotheses to explain their evolution. Two such hypotheses, "local adaptation" and "social adaptation" hypotheses, focus on the potential role of song in aiding recognition of males, either by locality or by social group. A quantitative survey of results from papers published on dialects, between 1962 and 2006, however, suggests limited direct support for functional hypotheses. An alternative set of hypotheses suggests that song features may diverge through "by-product" scenarios, in which selection for nonrecognition functions drives incidental changes in song structure, and geographic variation therein. Examples of such functions involve the evolution of song learning in neighbor-neighbor song sharing and the evolution of song learning in the context of sexual selection for male quality. We also describe scenarios by which songs may diverge indirectly through selection on components of the vocal apparatus such as body size and beak form and function. To conclude, we outline scenarios by which songs may diverge geographically; via cultural drift, genetic drift, cultural selection, natural selection, and sexual selection. Empirical study of these scenarios, together with countinued descriptions of vocal learning strategies and patterns of dispersal, may provide insights into vocal geographic evolution and thus propensities for speciation by reproductive isolation. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Field studies in urban environments suggest that birds may alter their communicative behaviour in response to noise, but there is little experimental evidence for a detrimental effect of urban noise on perception. We investigated the masking effects of urban noise on signal detection using operant tests with great tits in the laboratory. We compared masking effects induced by urban noise, woodland noise and a typical dawn chorus, including a variety of singing birds. Maskers were presented at their natural sound pressure level and masking conditions were compared to a silent no-masker condition. The signals to be detected were composed of artificial sinusoids and noise bands mimicking signal features of natural great tit song elements. Both masker condition and signal feature significantly affected signal detection in the captive great tits. Deteriorated auditory thresholds in woodland and urban noise required the signal to be on average 12 dB and 18 dB louder than in the no-masker condition, respectively. The dawn chorus masker showed the most dramatic shift in auditory threshold of about 29 dB. Signals with the sound energy concentrated within a narrow frequency range were on average easier to detect than signals spread over a wide frequency range. Our perceptual results provide insight into how birds may counteract negative masking effects by singing song elements with specific features. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Detection thresholds decreased with increasing signal duration. Thresholds at any given duration were a function of signal frequency and were elevated in background noise, but the shape of Great Tit TLD functions was independent of signal frequency and background condition. To enable comparisons of our Great Tit data to those from other species, TLD functions were first fitted with a traditional leaky-integrator model. We then applied a probabilistic model to interpret the trade-off between signal amplitude and duration at threshold. Great Tit TLD functions exhibit features that are similar across species. The current results, however, cannot explain why Great Tits in noisy urban environments produce shorter song elements or faster songs than those in quieter woodland environments, as detection thresholds are lower for longer elements also under noisy conditions.},

Complex communication may be described by attributes as diverse as a species' entire repertoire, signallers' individualistic signatures, or complex acoustic phenomena within single calls. Similarly, attributes of social complexity are diverse and may include group size, social role diversity, or networks of interactions and relationships. How these different attributes of social and communicative complexity co-evolve is an active question in behavioural ecology. Sciurid rodents (ground squirrels, prairie dogs and marmots) provide an excellent model system for studying these questions. Sciurid studies have found that demographic role complexity predicts alarm call repertoire size, while social group size predicts alarm call individuality. Along with other taxa, sciurids reveal an important insight: different attributes of sociality are linked to different attributes of communication. By breaking social and communicative complexity down to different attributes, focused studies can better untangle the underlying evolutionary relationships and move us closer to a comprehensive theory of how sociality and communication evolve. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Royal Society.},

We review this method in terms of geometric morphometric shape analysis and compare its properties to ordinary principal components analysis (PCA). We find that pPCA produces a shape space that preserves the Procrustes distances between objects, that allows shape models to be constructed, and that produces scores that can be used as shape variables for most purposes. Unlike ordinary PCA scores, however, the scores on pPC axes are correlated with one another and their variances do not correspond to the eigenvalues of the phylogenetically corrected axes. The pPC axes are oriented by the non-phylogenetic component of shape variation, but the positioning of the scores in the space retains phylogenetic covariance making the visual information presented in plots a hybrid of non-phylogenetic and phylogenetic. Presuming that all pPCA scores are used as shape variables, there is no difference between them and PCA scores for the construction of distance-based trees (such as UPGMA), for morphological disparity, or for ordinary multivariate statistical analyses (so long as the algorithms are suitable for correlated variables). pPCA scores yield different trait-based trees (such as maximum likelihood trees for continuous traits) because the scores are correlated and because the pPC axes differ from PC axes. pPCA eigenvalues represent the residual shape variance once the phylogenetic covariance has been removed (though there are scaling issues), and as such they provide information on covariance that is independent of phylogeny. Tests for modularity on pPCA eigenvalues will therefore yield different results than ordinary PCA eigenvalues. pPCA can be considered another tool in the kit of geometric morphometrics, but one whose properties are more difficult to interpret than ordinary PCA.

  abstract = {The hierarchy of channel networks in landscapes displays features that are characteristic of nonequilibrium complex systems. Here we show that a sequence of increasingly complex ridge and valley networks is produced by a system of partial differential equations coupling landscape evolution dynamics with a specific catchment area equation. By means of a linear stability analysis we identify the critical conditions triggering channel formation and the emergence of characteristic valley spacing. The ensuing channelization cascade, described by a dimensionless number accounting for diffusive soil creep, runoff erosion, and tectonic uplift, is reminiscent of the subsequent instabilities in fluid turbulence, while the structure of the simulated patterns is indicative of a tendency to evolve toward optimal configurations, with anomalies similar to dislocation defects observed in pattern-forming systems. The choice of specific geomorphic transport laws and boundary conditions strongly influences the channelization cascade, underlying the nonlocal and nonlinear character of its dynamics.}

To date, no empirical synthesis of research on these issues has been undertaken.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nObjective  To meta-analytically establish the extent of compromised mental health among refugees (including internally displaced persons, asylum seekers, and stateless persons) using a worldwide study sample. Potential moderators of mental health outcomes were examined, including enduring contextual variables (eg, postdisplacement accommodation and economic opportunity) and refugee characteristics.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nData Sources  Published studies (1959-2002) were obtained using broad searches of computerized databases (PsycINFO and PILOTS), manual searches of reference lists, and interviews with prominent authors.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nStudy Selection  Studies were selected if they investigated a refugee group and at least 1 nonrefugee comparison group and reported 1 or more quantitative group comparison on measures of psychopathology. Fifty-six reports met inclusion criteria (4.4\% of identified reports), yielding 59 independent comparisons and including 67 294 participants (22 221 refugees and 45 073 nonrefugees).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nData Extraction  Data on study and report characteristics, study participant characteristics, and statistical outcomes were extracted using a coding manual and subjected to blind recoding, which indicated high reliability. Methodological quality information was coded to assess potential sources of bias.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nData Synthesis  Effect size estimates for the refugee-nonrefugee comparisons were averaged across psychopathology measures within studies and weighted by sample size. The weighted mean effect size was 0.41 (SD, 0.02; range, -1.36 to 2.91 [SE, 0.01]), indicating that refugees had moderately poorer outcomes. Postdisplacement conditions moderated mental health outcomes. Worse outcomes were observed for refugees living in institutional accommodation, experiencing restricted economic opportunity, displaced internally within their own country, repatriated to a country they had previously fled, or whose initiating conflict was unresolved. Refugees who were older, more educated, and female and who had higher predisplacement socioeconomic status and rural residence also had worse outcomes. Methodological differences between studies affected effect sizes.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nConclusions  The sociopolitical context of the refugee experience is associated with refugee mental health. Humanitarian efforts that improve these conditions are likely to have positive impacts.\textbackslash n},

  abstract = {In birds, song divergence often precedes and facilitates divergence of other traits. We assessed the relative roles of cultural drift, innovation, and acoustic adaptation in divergence of island bird dialects, using silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis). In recently colonized populations, syllable diversity was not significantly lower than source populations, shared syllables between populations decreased with increasing number of founder events, and dialect variation displayed contributions from both habitat features and drift. The breadth of multivariate space occupied by recently colonized Z. l. lateralis populations was comparable to evolutionarily old forms that have diverged over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. In evolutionarily old subspecies, syllable diversity was comparable to the mainland and the amount of variation in syllable composition explained by habitat features increased by two- to threefold compared to recently colonized populations. Together these results suggest that cultural drift influences syllable repertoires in recently colonized populations, but innovation likely counters syllable loss from colonization. In evolutionarily older populations, the influence of acoustic adaptation increases, possibly favoring a high diversity of syllables. These results suggest that the relative importance of cultural drift and acoustic adaptation changes with time since colonization in island bird populations, highlighting the value of considering multiple mechanisms and timescale of divergence when investigating island song divergence.},

However, large-scale tests of this hypothesis using direct or longitudinal assessments of physiological health are lacking. Here, we investigate relationships between facial fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and detailed individual health histories in a sample (n = 4732) derived from a large longitudinal study (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) in South West England. Facial FA was assessed using geometric morphometric analysis of facial landmark configurations derived from three-dimensional facial scans taken at 15 years of age. Facial FA was not associated with longitudinal measures of childhood health. However, there was a very small negative association between facial FA and IQ that remained significant after correcting for a positive allometric relationship between FA and face size. Overall, this study does not support the idea that facial symmetry acts as a reliable cue to physiological health. Consequently, if preferences for facial symmetry do represent an evolved adaptation, then they probably function not to provide marginal fitness benefits by choosing between relatively healthy individuals on the basis of small differences in FA, but rather evolved to motivate avoidance of markers of substantial developmental disturbance and significant pathology.},

In western Eurasia this transition, the Upper Paleolithic, occurred about 45,000 years ago, but many of its features appear transiently in southern Africa about 45,000 years earlier. We show that demography is a major determinant in the maintenance of cultural complexity and that variation in regional subpopulation density and/or migratory activity results in spatial structuring of cultural skill accumulation. Genetic estimates of regional population size over time show that densities in early Upper Paleolithic Europe were similar to those in sub-Saharan Africa when modern behavior first appeared. Demographic factors can thus explain geographic variation in the timing of the first appearance of modern behavior without invoking increased cognitive capacity.},

The complexities of ecological observations and data present novel challenges in satisfying needs for reproducibility and also transparency. Ecological systems are dynamic and heterogeneous, interacting with numerous factors that sculpt natural history and that investigators cannot completely control. Observations may be highly dependent on spatial and temporal context, making them very difficult to reproduce, but computational reproducibility can still be achieved. Computational reproducibility often refers to the ability to produce equivalent analytical outcomes from the same data set using the same code and software as the original study. When coded workflows are shared, authors and editors provide transparency for readers and allow other researchers to build directly and efficiently on primary work. These qualities may be especially important in ecological applications that have important or controversial implications for science, management, and policy. Expectations for computational reproducibility and transparency are shifting rapidly in the sciences. In this work, we highlight many of the unique challenges for ecology along with practical guidelines for reproducibility and transparency, as ecologists continue to participate in the stewardship of critical environmental information and ensure that research methods demonstrate integrity.},

Here we sequence to high coverage a total of 79 wild- and captive-born individuals representing all six great ape species and seven subspecies and report 88.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. Our analysis provides support for genetically distinct populations within each species, signals of gene flow, and the split of common chimpanzees into two distinct groups: Nigeria-Cameroon/western and central/eastern populations. We find extensive inbreeding in almost all wild populations, with eastern gorillas being the most extreme. Inferred effective population sizes have varied radically over time in different lineages and this appears to have a profound effect on the genetic diversity at, or close to, genes in almost all species. We discover and assign 1,982 loss-of-function variants throughout the human and great ape lineages, determining that the rate of gene loss has not been different in the human branch compared to other internal branches in the great ape phylogeny. This comprehensive catalogue of great ape genome diversity provides a framework for understanding evolution and a resource for more effective management of wild and captive great ape populations.},

  abstract = {Conservationists are increasingly using autonomous acoustic recorders to determine the presence/absence and the abundance of bird species. Unlike humans, these recorders can be left in the field for extensive periods of time in any habitat. Although data acquisition is automated, manual processing of recordings is labour intensive, tedious, and prone to bias due to observer variations. Hence automated birdsong recognition is an efficient alternative. However, only few ecologists and conservationists utilise the existing birdsong recognisers to process unattended field recordings because the software calibration time is exceptionally high and requires considerable knowledge in signal processing and underlying systems, making the tools less user-friendly. Even allowing for these difficulties, getting accurate results is exceedingly hard. In this review we examine the state-of-the-art, summarising and discussing the methods currently available for each of the essential parts of a birdsong recogniser, and also available software. The key reasons behind poor automated recognition are that field recordings are very noisy, calls from birds that are a long way from the recorder can be faint or corrupted, and there are overlapping calls from many different birds. In addition, there can be large numbers of different species calling in one recording, and therefore the method has to scale to large numbers of species, or at least avoid misclassifying another species as one of particular interest. We found that these areas of importance, particularly the question of noise reduction, are amongst the least researched. In cases where accurate recognition of individual species is essential, such as in conservation work, we suggest that specialised (species-specific) methods of passive acoustic monitoring are required. We also believe that it is important that comparable measures, and datasets, are used to enable methods to be compared.},

  abstract = {Social bonds can have important fitness consequences. Although there is increasing evidence that social bonds carry over across contexts, few studies have investigated whether social bonds formed early in life are carried over to adulthood. For example, juveniles of monogamous species go through a major life-history stage transition, pair formation, during which the pair bond becomes a central unit of the social organization. At present, it remains unclear if pair members retain their early-life social bonds after pair formation and, if so, when they display these preferences most strongly. Here we investigated whether bonds formed early in life carry over into adulthood and whether carry-over was dependent on season, in a monogamous species. Moreover, we investigated the role of familiarity, genetic relatedness and aggression on the perseverance of social bonds. We studied the social structure before and after pair formation in captive barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), a highly social, long-lived, monogamous species. We constructed social networks of groups of geese before pair formation, during the subsequent breeding season, and in the following wintering season. From these networks, we identified the preferred associations among individuals, and how these are carried over during seasonal changes. We found that early-life associations in females were lost during the breeding season, but resurfaced during the subsequent wintering season. In males, the early-life associations persisted across both seasons, and were mediated by genetic relatedness and familiarity. The high level of aggressiveness of males, but not females, in the breeding season suggests that males may have played a key role in shaping both their own social environment and that of their female partners. By taking advantage of a captive population in which animals had no temporal or spatial restrictions to re-associate after pairing and for which we had complete data on their social history, we show that early-life social relationships can be maintained well into later life. Such bonds can be sustained even if they are temporarily disrupted, for example due to reproductive behaviour. Our findings therefore highlight that the early-life social environment can have life-long consequences on individuals' social environment.}

  abstract = {Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) has become widely accepted as a diagnosis amongs among medical professionals. The incorporation of the concept of PMS in popular culture is evidenced by the proliferation of articles in lay publications and trade books on the topic. Despite the acceptance of this diagnostic label, there is very little known about the etiology of PMS. The symptoms of PMS are numerous and diverse. Many of what are considered the most troubling symptoms involve emotions, with anger, irritability, and depression most common. Recent developments in the sociology of emotions have emphasized the normative nature of emotional experience. Utilizing this theoretical perspective, I propose that deviation from gender differentiated feeling and expression rules leads to the attribution or labeling of PMS. In this context, it is feelings and expressions of anger that are frequently the major concern. Available clinical descriptions and anecdotal evidence suggests that these emotions are often tied to conflicts with partners and/or chronic role strain related to domestic and paid labor. The attribution of PMS occurs through both self-labeling processes and labeling by others. In effect, emotional deviation is explained by the invocation of the concept of PMS. In this way emotional experiences are medicalized. This interpretation of PMS is explored in a content analysis of popular literature from the period 1970 to 1990. Articles about PMS from popular magazines are analyzed with attention to their emphasis on emotional symptoms. 131},

But our reading of the data differs from Lloyd's. In this essay, we outline why, unlike Caton (2006), whose review of Lloyd's book appeared previously in this journal, we are not persuaded by Lloyd's argument that female orgasm is a nonadaptive byproduct of orgasm in men. We hold this view because we disagree with the criteria Lloyd uses to evaluate evolutionary hypotheses, and because we believe Lloyd defines female orgasm too narrowly, ignoring critical information about its affective aspects.},

I agree that female orgasm is not as reliable as male orgasm in the context of penile-vaginal intercourse, and that women's reported orgasm frequencies are highly variable. But Wallen misrepresents these data, and both Wallen and Lloyd misinterpret them. Wallen claims that less than 20\% and possibly as few as 6\% of women achieve orgasm from penile stimulation alone. The rest require additional direct clitoral stimulation manually, orally, or mechanically to achieve orgasm. I cannot ascertain the source of the 6\% figure. Wallen confuses two different questions: (1) Given a copulatory orgasm, how often is manual stimulation required? (2) Given copulation, how often does orgasm occur? Wallen also follows Lloyd in asserting that women are too varied in their reported orgasm frequencies for female orgasm to be an adaptation. Unfortunately, this applies well to obligate traits, like height, but not nearly so well to facultative traits, like behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Whether women's orgasm is an adaptation is arguably the most contentious question in the study of the evolution of human sexuality. Indeed, this question is a veritable litmus test for adaptationism, separating those profoundly impressed with the pervasive and myriad correspondences between organisms' phenotypes and their conditions of life from those who apply the "onerous concept" of adaptation with more caution, skepticism or suspicion. Yet, the adaptedness of female orgasm is a question whose answer will elucidate mating dynamics in humans and nonhuman primates. There are two broad competing explanations for the evolution of orgasm in women: (1) the mate-choice hypothesis, which states that female orgasm has evolved to function in mate selection and (2) the byproduct hypothesis, which states that female orgasm has no evolutionary function, existing only because women share some early ontogeny with men, in whom orgasm is an adaptation. We review evidence for these hypotheses and identify areas where relevant evidence is lacking. Although additional research is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn, we find that the mate-choice hypothesis receives more support. Specifically, female orgasm appears to have evolved to increase the probability of fertilization from males whose genes would improve offspring fitness.},

  abstract = {It has been hypothesized that female orgasm evolved to facilitate recruitment of high-quality genes for offspring. Supporting evidence indicates that female orgasm promotes conception, although this may be mediated by the timing of female orgasm in relation to male ejaculation. This hypothesis also predicts that women will achieve orgasm more frequently when copulating with high-quality males, but limited data exist to support this prediction. We therefore explored relationships between the timing and frequency of women's orgasms and putative markers of the genetic quality of their mates, including measures of attractiveness, facial symmetry, dominance, and masculinity. We found that women reported more frequent and earlier-timed orgasms when mated to masculine and dominant men-those with high scores on a principal component characterized by high objectively-measured facial masculinity, observer-rated facial masculinity, partner-rated masculinity, and partner-rated dominance. Women reported more frequent orgasm during or after male ejaculation when mated to attractive men-those with high scores on a principal component characterized by high observer-rated and self-rated attractiveness. Putative measures of men's genetic quality did not predict their mates' orgasms from self-masturbation or from non-coital partnered sexual behavior. Overall, these results appear to support a role for female orgasm in sire choice. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Although the general ecological conditions that lead to dispersal have been well studied, the causes of individual variation in dispersal are less well understood. A number of recent studies suggest that heritable temperament \textemdash{} or personality \textemdash{} traits are correlated with dispersal in the wild but the extent to which these 'personality-dispersal syndromes' are general, how they depend on an individual's state and on spatial scale and whether they are temporally stable, both within and across individuals, remains unclear. 2. Here, we examine the relationship between exploration behaviour \textemdash{} an axis of personality that appears to be important in animals generally \textemdash{} and a variety of dispersal processes over 6 years in a population of the great tit Parus major. 3. Exploration behaviour was higher in immigrant than in locally born juveniles, but the difference was much larger for individuals with a small body mass, though independent of sex, representing one of the first examples of a state-dependent effect in a personality-dispersal syndrome. 4. Despite a temporal trend in exploration behaviour at the population level, the difference between immigrants and locally born birds remained stable over time, both across and within individuals. This suggests that the personality difference between immigrants and locally born birds is established early in development, but that the process of immigration interacts with both personality and state. 5. We found that the number of immigrant parents a locally born bird had did not influence exploration behaviour, suggesting either the difference between immigrants and residents was environmental or that the effect is overridden by local environmental sources of variation. 6. In contrast to previous work, we found no evidence for links between personality and natal dispersal distance within the population, either in terms of an individual's own exploration behaviour or that of its parents. 7. Our results suggest that there are links between individual differences in personality and dispersal, but that these can be dependent on differences in state among individuals and on the scale over which dispersal is measured. Future work should aim to understand the differences between dispersal within and between populations and the ways in which personality and state interact to determine the outcome of these processes.}

Increasingly, behavioural ecologists are studying innovativeness in wild populations, and uncovering links with functional behaviour and fitnessrelated traits. The relative importance of genetic and environmental factors in driving this variation, however, remains unknown. Here, we present the results of the first large-scale study to examine a range of causal factors underlying innovative problem-solving performance (PSP) among 831 great tits (Parus major) temporarily taken into captivity. Analyses show that PSP in this population: (i) was linked to a variety of individual factors, including age, personality and natal origin (immigrant or local-born); (ii) was influenced by natal environment, because individuals had a lower PSP when born in poor-quality habitat, or where local population density was high, leading to cohort effects. Links with many of the individual and environmental factors were present only in some years. In addition, PSP (iii) had little or no measurable eritability, as estimated by a Bayesian animal model; and (iv) was not influenced by maternal effects. Despite previous reports of links between PSP and a range of functional traits in this population, the analyses here suggest that innovativeness had weak if any evolutionary potential. Instead most individual variation was caused by phenotypic plasticity driven by links with other behavioural traits and by environmentally mediated developmental stress. Heritability estimates are population, time and context specific, however, and more studies are needed to determine the generality of these effects. Our results shed light on the causes of innovativeness within populations, and add to the debate on the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors in driving phenotypic variation within populations.},

In birds where females and males sing and create joint acoustic displays (duets), the processes defining the patterns of song sharing become more complex as there might be different selection pressures shaping the behaviour of each sex. To provide further insight into the vocal development and the dispersal strategy of duetting tropical species, we investigated the patterns of individual and pair repertoire sharing, as well as the stability of these repertoires, in a colour-marked population of riverside wrens, \emph{Cantorchilus semibadius,} located in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. Using data collected over a five-year period, we found considerable variation in the sharing levels of phrase and duet type repertoires among neighbouring individuals coupled with a general decline of repertoire sharing as distance increased between birds' territories. These results are consistent with a pattern predicted in age-restricted learners that establish preferentially near their tutors. Furthermore, we found no evidence of individuals changing their phrase type repertoires over time, including after remating events. Duet type repertoires were also stable when pairs remained together. However, we observed a surprisingly high turnover rate. When individuals remated, even though the majority of the previous duet type repertoire remained, several new duet types were included. Taken together, our findings suggest that riverside wrens might create their individual repertoires by copying their same-sex parent and neighbouring individuals before dispersal. Additionally, we speculate that even though birds were able to create new duet types after changing partners, a substantial portion of their duet type repertoire might also be copied from their parents and neighbouring pairs during the initial critical period of song learning.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}This article is protected by copyright.

  abstract = {According to common practice and oral tradition, learning verbal materials through song should facilitate word recall. In the present study, we provide evidence against this belief. In Experiment 1, 36 university students, half of them musicians, learned an unfamiliar song in three conditions. In the sung-sung condition, the song to be learned was sung, and the response was sung too. In the sung-spoken condition, the response was spoken. In the divided-spoken condition, the presented lyrics (accompanied by music) and the response were both spoken. Superior word recall in the sung-sung condition was predicted. However, fewer words were recalled when singing than when speaking. Furthermore, the mode of presentation, whether sung or spoken, had no influence on lyric recall, in either short- or long-term recall. In Experiment 2, singing was assessed with and without words. Altogether, the results indicate that the text and the melody of a song have separate representations in memory, making singing a dual task to perform, at least in the first steps of learning. Interestingly, musical training had little impact on performance, suggesting that vocal learning is a basic and widespread skill.},

Memory for simple visual features has proven vulnerable to distractors containing conflicting information along the relevant stimulus dimension, leading to the idea that interacting feature-specific channels at an early stage of visual processing support memory for simple visual features. Here we showed that memory for a single randomly orientated grating was susceptible to interference from a to-be-ignored distractor grating presented midway through a 3-s delay period. Memory for the initially presented orientation became noisier when it differed from the distractor orientation, and response distributions were shifted toward the distractor orientation (by approximately 3 degrees ). Interestingly, when the distractor was rendered task-relevant by making it a second memory target, memory for both retained orientations showed reduced reliability as a function of increased orientation differences between them. However, the degree to which responses to the first grating shifted toward the orientation of the task-relevant second grating was much reduced. Finally, using a dichoptic display, we demonstrated that these systematic biases caused by a consciously perceived distractor disappeared once the distractor was presented outside of participants' awareness. Together, our results show that visual short-term memory for orientation can be systematically biased by interfering information that is consciously perceived.},

Genetic homophily and heterophily influence the evolutionary dynamics of populations, because they potentially affect sexual and social selection. Here, we investigate the link between social interactions and allele frequencies in foraging flocks of great tits (Parus major) over three consecutive years. We constructed co-occurrence networks which explicitly described the splitting and merging of 85,602 flocks through time (fission\textendash fusion dynamics), at 60 feeding sites. Of the 1,711 birds in those flocks, we genotyped 962 individuals at 4,701 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). By combining genomewide genotyping with repeated field observations of the same individuals, we were able to investigate links between social structure and allele frequencies at a much finer scale than was previously possible. We explicitly accounted for potential spatial effects underlying genetic structure at the population level. We modelled social structure and spatial configuration of great tit fission\textendash fusion dynamics with eigenvector maps. Variance partitioning revealed that allele frequencies were strongly affected by group fidelity (explaining 27\%\textendash 45\% of variance) as individuals tended to maintain associations with the same conspecifics. These conspecifics were genetically more dissimilar than expected, shown by genomewide heterophily for pure social (i.e., space-independent) grouping preferences. Genomewide homophily was linked to spatial configuration, indicating spatial segregation of genotypes. We did not find evidence for homophily or heterophily for putative socially relevant candidate genes or any other SNP markers. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of distinguishing social and spatial processes in determining population structure.}

However, little attention has focused on how foragers assess these variables. It is commonly assumed that they do so visually, but many social species produce frequent calls while foraging, and these `close' calls might provide valuable spatial information. Here, we show that foraging pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor) are less vigilant when in larger groups, in the centre of a group and in closer proximity to another group member. We then show that foragers are less vigilant during playbacks of close calling by more individuals and individuals on either side of them when compared with calls of fewer individuals and calls on one side of them. These results suggest that foragers can use vocal cues to gain information on group size and their spatial position within a group. Future studies of anti-predator vigilance should consider the relative importance of both visual and vocal monitoring of group members.},

  abstract = {Looking across human societies reveals regularities in the languages that people speak and the concepts that they use. One explanation that has been proposed for these "cultural universals" is differences in the ease with which people learn particular languages and concepts. A difference in learnability means that languages and concepts possessing a particular property are more likely to be accurately transmitted from one generation of learners to the next. Intuitively, this difference could allow languages and concepts that are more learnable to become more prevalent after multiple generations of cultural transmission. If this is the case, the prevalence of languages and concepts with particular properties can be explained simply by demonstrating empirically that they are more learnable. We evaluate this argument using mathematical analysis and behavioral experiments. Specifically, we provide two counter-examples that show how greater learnability need not result in a property becoming prevalent. First, more learnable languages and concepts can nonetheless be less likely to be produced spontaneously as a result of transmission failures. We simulated cultural transmission in the laboratory to show that this can occur for memory of distinctive items: these items are more likely to be remembered, but not generated spontaneously once they have been forgotten. Second, when there are many languages or concepts that lack the more learnable property, sheer numbers can swamp the benefit produced by greater learnability. We demonstrate this using a second series of experiments involving artificial language learning. Both of these counter-examples show that simply finding a learnability bias experimentally is not sufficient to explain why a particular property is prevalent in the languages or concepts used in human societies: explanations for cultural universals based on cultural transmission need to consider the full set of hypotheses a learner could entertain and all of the kinds of errors that can occur in transmission. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Recent work has shown that (Vision) Transformer models (ViT) can achieve comparable or even superior performance on image classification tasks. This raises a central question: how are Vision Transformers solving these tasks? Are they acting like convolutional networks, or learning entirely different visual representations? Analyzing the internal representation structure of ViTs and CNNs on image classification benchmarks, we find striking differences between the two architectures, such as ViT having more uniform representations across all layers. We explore how these differences arise, finding crucial roles played by self-attention, which enables early aggregation of global information, and ViT residual connections, which strongly propagate features from lower to higher layers. We study the ramifications for spatial localization, demonstrating ViTs successfully preserve input spatial information, with noticeable effects from different classification methods. Finally, we study the effect of (pretraining) dataset scale on intermediate features and transfer learning, and conclude with a discussion on connections to new architectures such as the MLP-Mixer.},

  abstract = {How did rhythm originate in humans, and other species? One cross-cultural universal, frequently found in human music, is isochrony: when note onsets repeat regularly like the ticking of a clock. Another universal consists in synchrony (e.g. when individuals coordinate their notes so that they are sung at the same time). An approach to biomusicology focuses on similarities and differences across species, trying to build phylogenies of musical traits. Here we test for the presence of, and a link between, isochrony and synchrony in a non-human animal. We focus on the songs of one of the few singing primates, the lar gibbon (Hylobates lar), extracting temporal features from their solo songs and duets. We show that another ape exhibits one rhythmic feature at the core of human musicality: isochrony. We show that an enhanced call rate overall boosts isochrony, suggesting that respiratory physiological constraints play a role in determining the song's rhythmic structure. However, call rate alone cannot explain the flexible isochrony we witness. Isochrony is plastic and modulated depending on the context of emission: gibbons are more isochronous when duetting than singing solo. We present evidence for rhythmic interaction: we find statistical causality between one individual's note onsets and the co-singer's onsets, and a higher than chance degree of synchrony in the duets. Finally, we find a sex-specific trade-off between individual isochrony and synchrony. Gibbon's plasticity for isochrony and rhythmic overlap may suggest a potential shared selective pressure for interactive vocal displays in singing primates. This pressure may have convergently shaped human and gibbon musicality while acting on a common neural primate substrate. Beyond humans, singing primates are promising models to understand how music and, specifically, a sense of rhythm originated in the primate phylogeny.},

Development of the male phenotype in the absence of SRY probably resulted from the loss of function mutation in some unknown sex-determining gene, which normally inhibits the male pathway, or from a gain of function mutation in a gene downstream to SRY in male pathway.},

  abstract = {We present a theory of human artistic experience and the neural mechanisms that mediate it. Any theory of art (or, indeed, any aspect of human nature) has to ideally have three components. (a) The logic of art: whether there are universal rules or principles; (b) The evolutionary rationale: why did these rules evolve and why do they have the form that they do; (c) What is the brain circuitry involved? Our paper begins with a quest for artistic universals and proposes a list of `Eight laws of artistic experience' \textemdash{} a set of heuristics that artists either consciously or unconsciously deploy to optimally titillate the visual areas of the brain. One of these principles is a psychological phenomenon called the peak shift effect: If a rat is rewarded for discriminating a rectangle from a square, it will respond even more vigorously to a rectangle that is longer and skinnier that the prototype. We suggest that this principle explains not only caricatures, but many other aspects of art. Example: An evocative sketch of a female nude may be one which selectively accentuates those feminine form-attributes that allow one to discriminate it from a male figure; a Boucher, a Van Gogh, or a Monet may be a caricature in `colour space' rather than form space. Even abstract art may employ `supernormal' stimuli to excite form areas in the brain more strongly than natural stimuli. Second, we suggest that grouping is a very basic principle. The different extrastriate visual areas may have evolved specifically to extract correlations in different domains (e.g. form, depth, colour), and discovering and linking multiple features (`grouping') into unitary clusters \textemdash{} objects \textemdash{} is facilitated and reinforced by direct connections from these areas to limbic structures. In general, when object-like entities are partially discerned at any stage in the visual hierarchy, messages are sent back to earlier stages to alert them to certain locations or features in order to look for additional evidence for the object (and these processes may be facilitated by direct limbic activation). Finally, given constraints on allocation of attentional resources, art is most appealing if it produces heightened activity in a single dimension (e.g. through the peak shift principle or through grouping) rather than redundant activation of multiple modules. This idea may help explain the effectiveness of outline drawings and sketches, the savant syndrome in autists, and the sudden emergence of artistic talent in fronto-temporal dementia. In addition to these three basic principles we propose five others, constituting a total of `eight laws of aesthetic experience' (analogous to the Buddha's eightfold path to wisdom).},

  abstract = {Geographic patterns of song variation are common in passerines and can develop as a consequence of the mechanisms of song acquisition and dispersal. In particular, the timing of dispersal relative to the sensory learning phase and the time of song crystallization is important. For example, when the sensory phase continues after dispersal or when males learn new songs every breeding season, i.e. open-ended learner, neighborhoods can develop where males share their songs. In this study, we utilize a unique, comprehensive dispersal and song recording dataset to investigate the existence and development of micro-geographic song variation in a wild passerine population. Machine learning song analysis methods allow us to overcome perceptual bias in the classification of the songs of New Zealand hihi (Notiomystis cincta). We show that males share more song elements of their repertoire with their neighbors than with more distant males or with males from the same natal area, implying that repertoire is acquired post-dispersal. Finally, we suggest that high levels of male competition have driven the development of post-dispersal vocal learning behavior in this species.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research on risk factors for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is lacking for the Gulf countries of the Middle East, a region with unique cultural features that might influence expectations and self-perception of the disease. We examined the association of PMS frequency with possible risk factors for the disease. METHODS: Using a self-report questionnaire, we surveyed all eligible young women (n=464) enrolled in the medical, nursing and medical technology/respiratory therapy educational programs at a university in Dammam. Women were asked about the frequency of symptoms during the previous six months. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to determine which of several biopsychosocial and dietary factors influenced the premenstrual symptom score. RESULTS: At least one premenstrual symptom was experienced by 448 women (96.6\%), and 176 (37.5\%) had a high symptom severity score. Premenstrual symptom frequency was significantly associated with a maternal history of premenstrual syndrome, self-perception of mental stress, physical activity, consumption of sweet-tasting foods, and coffee, but these factors only explained 14\% of the variability in the multiple regression model. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that women vulnerable to mental stress take advantage of relaxation techniques and psychotropic therapies. Moreover, women with PMS might eliminate sweet-tasting food and caffeine-containing beverages, particularly coffee, from their diet.},

Here we discuss the evidence in favor of a genetic and epigenetic basis for sexually dimorphic behavior, as a consequence of underlying differences in the regulation of genes that drive brain function.

Here, we investigated the composition and information content of sentinel call sequences in meerkats (\emph{Suricata suricatta}). While being on sentinel guard, a coordinated vigilance behaviour, meerkats produce long sequences composed of six distinct sentinel call types and alarm calls. We analysed recordings of sentinels to test if the order of the call types is graded and whether they contain additional group-, individual-, age- or sex-specific vocal signatures.}

  abstract = {A central goal of biomusicology is to understand the biological basis of human musicality. One approach to this problem has been to compare core components of human musicality (relative pitch perception, entrainment, etc.) with similar capacities in other animal species. Here we extend and clarify this comparative approach with respect to rhythm. First, whereas most comparisons between human music and animal acoustic behavior have focused on spectral properties (melody and harmony), we argue for the central importance of temporal properties, and propose that this domain is ripe for further comparative research. Second, whereas most rhythm research in non-human animals has examined animal timing in isolation, we consider how chorusing dynamics can shape individual timing, as in human music and dance, arguing that group behavior is key to understanding the adaptive functions of rhythm. To illustrate the interdependence between individual and chorusing dynamics, we present a computational model of chorusing agents relating individual call timing with synchronous group behavior. Third, we distinguish and clarify mechanistic and functional explanations of rhythmic phenomena, often conflated in the literature, arguing that this distinction is key for understanding the evolution of musicality. Fourth, we expand biomusicological discussions beyond the species typically considered, providing an overview of chorusing and rhythmic behavior across a broad range of taxa (orthopterans, fireflies, frogs, birds, and primates). Finally, we propose an "Evolving Signal Timing" hypothesis, suggesting that similarities between timing abilities in biological species will be based on comparable chorusing behaviors. We conclude that the comparative study of chorusing species can provide important insights into the adaptive function(s) of rhythmic behavior in our "proto-musical" primate ancestors, and thus inform our understanding of the biology and evolution of rhythm in human music and language.},

While some techniques-like circular statistics or grammar induction-rely on strong top-down assumptions, assumption-free techniques can only provide limited insights on higher-order rhythmic structure. I suggest that research in music perception and performance can benefit from systematically adopting phase space plots, a visualization technique originally developed in mathematical physics that overcomes the aforementioned limitations. By jointly plotting adjacent interonset intervals (IOI), the motivic rhythmic structure of musical phrases, if present, is visualized geometrically without making any a priori assumptions concerning isochrony, beat induction, or metrical hierarchies. I provide visual examples and describe how particular features of rhythmic patterns correspond to geometrical shapes in phase space plots. I argue that research on music perception and systematic musicology stands to benefit from this descriptive tool, particularly in comparative analyses of rhythm production. Phase space plots can be employed as an initial assumption-free diagnostic to find higher order structures (i.e., beyond distributional regularities) before proceeding to more specific, theory-driven analyses.},

Evidence from a broad range of human cultures suggests the existence of musical universals, here defined as strong regularities emerging across cultures above chance. In particular, humans demonstrate a general proclivity for rhythm, although little is known about why music is particularly rhythmic and why the same structural regularities are present in rhythms around the world. We empirically investigate the mechanisms underlying musical universals for rhythm, showing how music can evolve culturally from randomness. Human participants were asked to imitate sets of randomly generated drumming sequences and their imitation attempts became the training set for the next participants in independent transmission chains. By perceiving and imitating drumming sequences from each other, participants turned initially random sequences into rhythmically structured patterns. Drumming patterns developed into rhythms that are more structured, easier to learn, distinctive for each experimental cultural tradition and characterized by all six statistical universals found among world music; the patterns appear to be adapted to human learning, memory and cognition. We conclude that musical rhythm partially arises from the influence of human cognitive and biological biases on the process of cultural evolution.},

  abstract = {Music is a peculiar human behavior, yet we still know little as to why and how music emerged. For centuries, the study of music has been the sole prerogative of the humanities. Lately, however, music is being increasingly investigated by psychologists, neuroscientists, biologists, and computer scientists. One approach to studying the origins of music is to empirically test hypotheses about the mechanisms behind this structured behavior. Recent lab experiments show how musical rhythm and melody can emerge via the process of cultural transmission. In particular, Lumaca and Baggio (2017) tested the emergence of a sound system at the boundary between music and language. In this study, participants were given random pairs of signal-meanings; when participants negotiated their meaning and played a ``game of telephone'' with them, these pairs became more structured and systematic. Over time, the small biases introduced in each artificial transmission step accumulated, displaying quantitative trends, including the emergence, over the course of artificial human generations, of features resembling properties of language and music. In this Note, we highlight the importance of Lumaca and Baggio's experiment, place it in the broader literature on the evolution of language and music, and suggest refinements for future experiments. We conclude that, while psychological evidence for the emergence of proto-musical features is accumulating, complementary work is needed: Mathematical modeling and computer simulations should be used to test the internal consistency of experimentally generated hypotheses and to make new predictions.},

Some scientists focused on musicality, namely the human biocognitive predispositions for music, with an emphasis on cross-cultural similarities. Other scholars investigated music, seen as cultural product, focusing on the large variation in world musical cultures. Recent experiments found deep connections between music and musicality, reconciling these opposing views. Here we address the question of how individual cognitive biases affect the process of cultural evolution of music. Data from two experiments is analyzed using two different, complementary techniques. In the experiments, participants hear drumming patterns and imitate them. These patterns are then given to the same or another participant to imitate. The structure of these - initially random - patterns is tracked down to later experimental 'generations'. Frequentist statistics show how participants' biases are amplified by cultural transmission, making drumming patterns more structured. Structure is achieved faster than in transmission within, rather than between, participants. A Bayesian model approximates the motif structures participants learned and created. Overall, our data and model show that individual biases for musicality play a central role in shaping cultural transmission of musical rhythm.},

  abstract = {One curious aspect of human timing is the organization of rhythmic patterns in small integer ratios. Behavioral and neural research has shown that adjacent time intervals in rhythms tend to be perceived and reproduced as approximate fractions of small numbers (e.g., 3/2). Recent work on iterated learning and reproduction further supports this: given a randomly timed drum pattern to reproduce, participants subconsciously transform it toward small integer ratios. The mechanisms accounting for this ``attractor'' phenomenon are little understood, but might be explained by combining two theoretical frameworks from psychophysics. The scalar expectancy theory describes time interval perception and reproduction in terms of Weber's law: just detectable durational differences equal a constant fraction of the reference duration. The notion of categorical perception emphasizes the tendency to perceive time intervals in categories, i.e., ``short'' vs. ``long.'' In this piece, we put forward the hypothesis that the integer-ratio bias in rhythm perception and production might arise from the interaction of the scalar property of timing with the categorical perception of time intervals, and that neurally it can plausibly be related to oscillatory activity. We support our integrative approach with mathematical derivations to formalize assumptions and provide testable predictions. We present equations to calculate durational ratios by: (i) parameterizing the relationship between durational categories, (ii) assuming a scalar timing constant, and (iii) specifying one (of K) category of ratios. Our derivations provide the basis for future computational, behavioral, and neurophysiological work to test our model.},

  abstract = {Understanding worldwide patterns of language diversity has long been a goal for evolutionary scientists, linguists and philosophers. Research over the past decade has suggested that linguistic diversity may result from differences in the social environments in which languages evolve. Specifically, recent work found that languages spoken in larger communities typically have more systematic grammatical structures. However, in the real world, community size is confounded with other social factors such as network structure and the number of second languages learners in the community, and it is often assumed that linguistic simplification is driven by these factors instead. Here, we show that in contrast to previous assumptions, community size has a unique and important influence on linguistic structure. We experimentally examine the live formation of new languages created in the laboratory by small and larger groups, and find that larger groups of interacting participants develop more systematic languages over time, and do so faster and more consistently than small groups. Small groups also vary more in their linguistic behaviours, suggesting that small communities are more vulnerable to drift. These results show that community size predicts patterns of language diversity, and suggest that an increase in community size might have contributed to language evolution.}

For sex chromosomes, we demonstrate a pattern of obligate dosage sensitivity amongst evolutionarily preserved X-Y homologs, and update prevailing theoretical models for SCD compensation by detecting X-linked genes whose expression increases with decreasing X- and/or Y-chromosome dosage. We further show that SCD-sensitive sex chromosome genes regulate specific co-expression networks of SCD-sensitive autosomal genes with critical cellular functions and a demonstrable potential to mediate previously documented SCD effects on disease. Our findings detail wide-ranging effects of SCD on genome function with implications for human phenotypic variation.},

The only common and obvious features are high stature and a strong build.

More recent developments in genetics and neuroimaging have led to new publications on the relationship between the presence of an extra Y chromosome and social function, trying to explain the possible increasing tendency to commit a crime and to search for a biological nature of human behavior and deviant conducts. The authors conduct a review of the literature of the last 50. years concerning this chromosome trisomy, focusing on a possible connection between 47,XYY and deviance.

  abstract = {Several ecological and behavioural factors are correlated with interspecific differences in the complexity and temporal arrangement of passerine songs. For example, song repertoires are larger in species where males provide more parental care; syllable repertoire sizes are greater in polygynous species; migrants have larger song and syllable repertoires; and more vocalization during a song bout is associated with higher fecundities and lower metabolic rates. These associations often differ at different taxonomic levels, suggesting that the factors causing divergence in song characters within genera are different from those responsible for divergence among more distantly related taxa. In general, correlates of greater song complexity can be interpreted as those factors likely to produce more intense inter- or intra-sexual selection (polygyny, migration, paternal care). Measures of song output are correlated with factors likely to be associated with species differences in energetic requirements (metabolic rate) or reproductive effort (fecundity). The ecological and behavioural correlates of within-song complexity differ from those of between-song complexity, suggesting that they are not alternative solutions to the same selective pressures. -Authors},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Negative premenstrual change can result in distress for a significant proportion of women. Previous research has suggested that women employ a range of coping strategies and behaviours in order to manage and reduce premenstrual distress. However, as yet there has been no specific scale available to measure premenstrual coping. This research aimed to develop and validate a measure of premenstrual coping which can be used in future investigations of negative premenstrual experience. METHODS: A sample of 250 women living in Australia, reporting mild to severe premenstrual distress, completed an online survey containing 64 items related to premenstrual coping. The items were generated by reviewing past literature related to premenstrual experience, in particular recent qualitative research on premenstrual coping. A principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation was conducted to determine item clusters that would form a measure. Reliability and validity were tested using calculations of Cronbach alphas, correlational analysis with psychological coping scales and a content analysis of participant reports of coping strategies. RESULTS: The factor analysis, which involved two principal component analyses, resulted in five factors containing 32 premenstrual coping behaviours. Interpretation of the factor solution drew on empirical and theoretical accounts of premenstrual coping and the emergent factors were labelled Avoiding Harm, Awareness and Acceptance of Premenstrual Change, Adjusting Energy, Self-Care, and Communicating. These factors form the subscales of the Premenstrual Coping Measure (PMCM). The subscales demonstrated acceptable to very good reliability and tests of construct, concurrent and content validity were supportive of sound validity. CONCLUSIONS: The PMCM provides a valid and reliable scale for quantifying ways of coping specific to negative premenstrual change. Conceptual similarity was found between some coping behaviours and behaviours positioned as symptoms of premenstrual change. Explanations for this overlap may be found in cultural discourses associated with idealised femininity and PMS (premenstrual syndrome). Further psychometric investigation of the PMCM will enhance knowledge of the role of coping with negative premenstrual experience.},

  abstract = {and Keywords This chapter reveals bird song as the classic case where individual animals learn their behaviour from others, usually young birds from adults, so that particular songs are passed on from one individual to another through cultural transmission. This chapter outlines the sorts of changes that may take place, at the level of elements, song types and repertoires, and also several distinct ways in which novel songs may arise in a population (immigration, innovation, invention, and improvisation). Much of the evidence is that such changes are random, and that their consequences are either neutral or negative, but some cases have been described where there have been progressive changes in song within a population. These are likely to stem from individuals adapting their songs to match a changing physical or social environment. The individual that generates variety and stands out from the crowd may also benefit through sexual selection, with a tension between innovation and conformity.},

  abstract = {Languages with many speakers tend to be structurally simple while small communities sometimes develop languages with great structural complexity. Paradoxically, the opposite pattern appears to be observed for non-structural properties of language such as vocabulary size. These apparently opposite patterns pose a challenge for theories of language change and evolution. We use computational simulations to show that this inverse pattern can depend on a single factor: ease of diffusion through the population. A population of interacting agents was arranged on a network, passing linguistic conventions to one another along network links. Agents can invent new conventions, or replicate conventions that they have previously generated themselves or learned from other agents. Linguistic conventions are eitherEasyorHardto diffuse, depending on how many times an agent needs to encounter a convention to learn it. In large groups, only linguistic conventions that are easy to learn, such as words, tend to proliferate, whereas small groups where everyone talks to everyone else allow for more complex conventions, like grammatical regularities, to be maintained. Our simulations thus suggest that language, and possibly other aspects of culture, may become simpler at the structural level as our world becomes increasingly interconnected.},

We compared the acoustic structure of vocal signals in groups of macaques belonging to four species with varying levels of uncertainty (i.e. complexity) in social tolerance (the higher the degree of tolerance, the higher the degree of uncertainty): two intolerant species, Japanese and rhesus macaques, and two tolerant species, Tonkean and crested macaques. We recorded the vocalizations emitted by adult females in affiliative, agonistic and neutral contexts. We analysed several acoustic variables: call duration, entropy, time and frequency energy quantiles. The results showed that tolerant macaques displayed higher levels of vocal diversity and flexibility than intolerant macaques in situations with a greater number of options and consequences, i.e. in agonistic and affiliative contexts. We found no significant differences between tolerant and intolerant macaques in the neutral context where individuals are not directly involved in social interaction. This shows that species experiencing more uncertain social interactions displayed greater vocal diversity and flexibility, which supports the social complexity hypothesis.}

To obtain insight into the changes introduced by artists, we compared Fourier power spectra in photographs of faces and in portraits by artists. Our analysis was restricted to a large set of monochrome or lightly colored portraits from various Western cultures and revealed a paradoxical result. Although face photographs are not scale-invariant, artists draw human faces with statistical properties that deviate from the face photographs and approximate the scale-invariant, fractal-like properties of complex natural scenes. This result cannot be explained by systematic differences in the complexity of patterns surrounding the faces or by reproduction artifacts. In particular, a moderate change in gamma gradation has little influence on the results. Moreover, the scale-invariant rendering of faces in artists' portraits was found to be independent of cultural variables, such as century of origin or artistic techniques. We suggest that artists have implicit knowledge of image statistics and prefer natural scene statistics (or some other rules associated with them) in their creations. Fractal-like statistics have been demonstrated previously in other forms of visual art and may be a general attribute of esthetic visual stimuli.},

METHODS A population-based record linkage study identified cancers in 472,378 people with AIDS (1980\textendash 2006). Using non-parametric competing risk methods, we estimated cumulative incidence of cancer across 3 calendar periods (AIDS onset in 1980\textendash 1989, 1990\textendash 1995, and 1996\textendash 2006). RESULTS Measured at 5-years after AIDS onset, cumulative incidence of AIDS-defining cancer (ADC) declined sharply across AIDS calendar periods (from 18\% in 1980\textendash 1989, to 11\% in 1990\textendash 1995, to 4.2\% in 1996\textendash 2006 [i.e., HAART era]). Cumulative incidence of Kaposi sarcoma declined from 14.3\% during 1980\textendash 1989 to 6.7\% during 1990\textendash 1995 to 1.8\% during 1996\textendash 2006. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cumulative incidence declined from 3.8\% during 1990\textendash 1995 to 2.2\% during 1996\textendash 2006; during the HAART era, NHL was the commonest (53\%) ADC. Cumulative incidence of non-AIDS-defining cancer (NADC) increased from 1.1\% to 1.5\% with no change thereafter (1.0\%, 1996\textendash 2006), in part due to declines in competing mortality. However, cumulative incidence increased steadily over time for specific NADCs (anal cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and liver cancer). Lung cancer cumulative incidence increased from 0.14\% during 1980\textendash 1989 to 0.32\% during 1990\textendash 1995, with no change thereafter. CONCLUSIONS We noted dramatically declining cumulative incidence of 2 major ADCs (Kaposi sarcoma and NHL) and increases in some NADCs (specifically cancers of the anus, liver, and lung, and Hodgkin lymphoma). As HIV/AIDS is increasingly managed as a chronic disease, greater attention should be focused on cancer screening and prevention.},

For comparison, we analysed the same second-order image properties in photographs of diverse natural patterns and man-made objects and scenes. Results showed that Shannon entropy of relative orientations of edge pairs was high and parallelism was low for the paintings and some of the natural patterns, but differed from other sets of photographs, including other man-made stimuli. The differences were also observed when images were matched for image content. Moreover, high entropy of edge orientations was found in traditional artworks produced by different techniques, in artworks that represented different content matter and art genres, as well as in artworks from other cultural backgrounds (East Asian and Islamic). In conclusion, we found that high entropy of edge orientations characterizes diverse sets of traditional artworks from various cultural backgrounds.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous formation of locally ordered patterns during dewetting of thin films on homogeneous and heterogeneous substrates is investigated based on the 3-D nonlinear equation of motion. Physicochemical heterogeneities engender the rapid formation of the primary holes that serve as "seeds" for the formation of locally ordered structures. The secondary multiring structure surrounding the primary hole evolves by one of the following two different pathways depending on the film thickness vis-\`a-vis the location of the minimum in the spinodal curve: (A) Thick films evolve by the formation of secondary satellite holes that originate from a ring-like depression behind the rim of the primary hole. The process of ordering is repeated until the true spinodal holes appear on the remaining substrate. (B) Ordering in a relatively thin film occurs by the formation of droplets caused by the disintegration of the elevated rim that surrounds the primary hole. The radial distance between the successive ordered layers is close to the spinodal length scale, lambda(m). Droplets within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly greater than lambda(m), whereas holes within the same layer are separated by a distance slightly less than lambda(m). The number density of holes or droplets in the ordered pattern is of the same order as the predictions of the spinodal theory. The number of ordered layers and the size of the locally ordered domain depend significantly on the relative magnitudes of the time scales for the following events: (1) formation of the primary hole, (2) growth of holes (inverse of hole-growth velocity), (3) formation of a secondary feature (hole or droplet) adjacent to the primary hole, (4) true spinodal rupture far from the primary hole. The morphology of an ordered structure can therefore be tailored by modulation of the film thickness and the short- and long-range intermolecular interactions (substrate surface properties), since these affect the time scales 1 to 4 in different ways.},

  abstract = {PMS has existed at least since the beginning of medical writing, and is estimated to affect large proportions of women worldwide. But the etiology remains unknown, diagnostic definition and methods vary tremendously, and treatment is wholly symptom-oriented. This poor state of understanding has been attributed to a lack of theoretical perspective. The current work provides such a theoretical perspective from an evolutionary paradigm. PMS is not evolutionarily adaptive in and of itself. Rather, it is part of a cyclic pattern that results from the cessation of heightened, positive physical and sociobehavioral states that are evolutionarily favored during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle for some women. When the advantage of these positive states diminishes, they cease, causing relatively lower states that are subjectively experienced as symptoms. In its clinical extreme, this is PMS. However, eons of evolution would result in modern women who are choosy about the conditions under which they reproduce. Thus, women whose conditions suggest a high probability of successful immediate reproduction are expected to experience the heightened, positive states during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle to attract mates and fertilizations; these women will experience symptoms premenstrually. But women whose conditions suggest a low probability of successful immediate reproduction are expected to experience the heightened, positive states during the premenstruum to retain mates, accrue or maintain resources, and/or otherwise improve their conditions; these women will experience symptoms during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle ("pseudo-PMS"). In addition, the heightened states are expected to shift in response to changes in conditions throughout women's lives, being expressed at whatever point is most evolutionarily beneficial given current conditions. This suggests that our conceptualization of PMS should be reframed within a facultative (condition-sensitive), evolutionary model. It also generates predictions both within- and between women that should elucidate the syndrome. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Reiber (2008) recently published an evolutionary model in which PMS is hypothesized to be a byproduct of adaptations that maximize chances of mating and fertilization during the follicular phase of the cycle. How a woman feels during the follicular phase of the cycle should be predictable by evolutionarily relevant variables related to reproduction, such as age, parity, and resources. Prospective daily symptom ratings from 170 women support this view. Symptom load during the follicular week was significantly negatively correlated with age and resources, and positively correlated with parity. Women meeting diagnostic criteria for PMS had significantly lower total symptom loads (that is, they felt better) during the follicular week of the cycle than did women without PMS. This suggests that women have PMS not because something negative happens with the approach of the premenstruum, but rather because evolutionarily adaptive positive states are fostered during the follicular phase of the cycle for some women. This conceptual shift may lead to improvement in definitional and diagnostic approaches, more fruitful proximate research, and better clinical treatment.

We analyse 25 diverse groups in India to provide strong evidence for two ancient populations, genetically divergent, that are ancestral to most Indians today. One, the 'Ancestral North Indians' (ANI), is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans, whereas the other, the 'Ancestral South Indians' (ASI), is as distinct from ANI and East Asians as they are from each other. By introducing methods that can estimate ancestry without accurate ancestral populations, we show that ANI ancestry ranges from 39-71\% in most Indian groups, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers. Groups with only ASI ancestry may no longer exist in mainland India. However, the indigenous Andaman Islanders are unique in being ASI-related groups without ANI ancestry. Allele frequency differences between groups in India are larger than in Europe, reflecting strong founder effects whose signatures have been maintained for thousands of years owing to endogamy. We therefore predict that there will be an excess of recessive diseases in India, which should be possible to screen and map genetically.},

We captured male juvenile dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis thurberi) from two recently diverged populations (urban and mountain) soon after they reached independence (aged 25-40 days), raised them in identical indoor aviaries, and studied their songs at an age of three years. We found that the large population difference in minimum frequency observed in the field persisted undiminished in the common garden despite the absence of noise. We also found some song sharing between the common garden and natal field populations, indicating that early song memorization before capture could contribute to the persistent song differences in adulthood. These results are the first to show that frequency shifts in urban birdsong are maintained in the absence of noise by genetic evolution and/or early life experiences.}

Ingrid Reisert and Christoph Pilgrim review sexual dimorphisms of monoaminergic systems, which also appear to be generated by sex steroids. However, there are a number of observations that are not explainable by the 'androgen theory of sexual differentiation'. Results obtained from cultures of embryonic rat brain tissue appear to indicate that dopaminergic neurons may develop morphological and functional sex differences in the absence of sex steroids. Hormone-independent and -dependent developmental processes may affect diencephalic and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in a regionally diverse fashion. Factors other than sex steroids need to be examined. It is possible that some sexual dimorphisms in the nervous system may develop under primary genetic control.},

  abstract = {A major goal in anthropological genetics is the assessment of the effects of different microevolutionary forces. Harpending and Ward (1982) developed a model that aids in this effort by comparing observed and expected heterozygosity within populations in a local region. The expected heterozygosity within a population is a function of the total heterozygosity of the entire region and the distance of the population from the regional mean centroid of allele frequencies. Greater than average gene flow from an external source will result in a population having greater heterozygosity than expected. Less than average gene flow from an external source will result in a population having less heterozygosity than expected. We extend the Harpending-Ward model to quantitative traits using an equal and additive effects model of inheritance. Here the additive genetic variance within a population is directly proportional to heterozygosity, and its expectation is directly proportional to the genetic distance from the centroid. Under certain assumptions the expectations for phenotypic variances are similar. Observed and expected genetic or phenotypic variance can then be compared to assess the effects of differential external gene flow. When the additive genetic covariance matrix or heritabilities are not known, the phenotypic covariance matrix can be used to provide a conservative application of the model. In addition, we develop new methods for estimation of the genetic relationship matrix (R) from quantitative traits. We apply these models to two data sets: (1) six principal components derived from twenty dermatoglyphic ridge count measures for nine villages in Nepal and (2) ten anthropometric measurements for seven isolated populations in western Ireland. In both cases both the univariate and multivariate analyses provide results that can be directly interpreted in terms of historically known patterns of gene flow.},

  abstract = {Previous studies of genetic markers and mitochondrial DNA have found that the amount of variation among major geographic groupings of Homo sapiens is relatively low, accounting for roughly 10\% of total variation. This conclusion has had implications for the study of human variation and consideration of alternative models for the origin of modern humans. By contrast, it has often been assumed that the level of among-group variation for morphological traits is much higher. This study examines the level of among-group variation based on craniometric data from a large sample of modern humans originally collected by W. W. Howells. A multivariate method based on quantitative genetics theory was used to provide an estimate of FST--a measure of among-group variation that can be compared with results from studies of genetic markers. Data for 57 craniometric variables on 1,734 crania were analyzed. These data represent six core areas: Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, Australasia, Polynesia, the Americas, and the Far East. An additional set of analyses was performed using a three-region subset (Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Far East) to provide comparability with several genetic studies. The minimum FST (assuming complete heritability) for the three-region analysis is 0.065, and the minimum FST for the six-region analysis is 0.085. Both of these are less than the average FST from genetic studies (average estimates of 0.10-0.11). The smaller value of the minimum FST estimates is expected since it provides an estimate of FST expected under complete heritability. Using an estimate of average craniometric heritability from the literature provides an estimate of FST of 0.112 for the three-region analysis and 0.144 for the six-region analysis. These results show that genetic and craniometric data are in agreement, qualitatively and quantitatively, and that there is limited variation in modern humans among major geographic regions.},

  abstract = {This study examines the genetic impact of the Great Famine (1846-1851) on the regional genetic structure of Ireland. The Great Famine resulted in a rapid decrease in population size throughout Ireland in a short period of time, increasing the possibility of genetic drift. Our study is based on migration and anthropometric data collected originally in the 1930s from 7211 adult Irish males. These data were subdivided into three time periods defined by year of birth: 1861-1880, 1881-1900, and 1901-1920. Within each time period the data were further subdivided into six geographic regions of Ireland. Estimates of Wright's FST were calculated from parent-offspring migration data and from 17 anthropometric variables (10 head measures, 7 body measures). Over time, the average population size decreased, but average rates of migration increased. The estimates of FST at equilibrium from migration matrix analysis suggest that the net effect of these opposite effects is a reduction in among-group variation. Closer examination shows that within each time period the rate of convergence to equilibrium is slow, meaning that the expected levels of genetic homogeneity revealed from migration matrix analysis are not likely to be seen over short intervals of time. Estimates of FST from anthropometric data show either relatively little change in microdifferentiation or some increase, depending on which variables are analyzed. Investigation of a simple model of demographic and genetic change shows that, given the demographic changes in post-Famine Ireland, FST could in theory increase, decrease, or remain the same over short intervals of time. Overall, the Great Famine appears to have had minimal impact on the genetic structure of Ireland on a regional level. Comparison with studies focusing on local genetic structure shows the opposite. It appears that the level of genetic impact depends strongly on the level of analysis; local populations are affected to a greater extent by demographic shifts than regional populations. We also provide formulas for the standard errors of FST from metric traits and related statistics.},

Despite the ubiquity of drumming across human cultures, its origins and the brain regions specialized in processing such signals remain unexplored. Here, we report that an important animal model for vocal communication, the macaque monkey, also displays drumming behavior, and we exploit this finding to show that vocal and nonvocal communication sounds are represented by overlapping networks in the brain's temporal lobe. Observing social macaque groups, we found that these animals use artificial objects to produce salient periodic sounds, similar to acoustic gestures. Behavioral tests confirmed that these drumming sounds attract the attention of listening monkeys similarly as conspecific vocalizations. Furthermore, in a preferential looking experiment, drumming sounds influenced the way monkeys viewed their conspecifics, suggesting that drumming serves as a multimodal signal of social dominance. Finally, by using high-resolution functional imaging we identified those brain regions preferentially activated by drumming sounds or by vocalizations and found that the representations of both these communication sounds overlap in caudal auditory cortex and the amygdala. The similar behavioral responses to drumming and vocal sounds, and their shared neural representation, suggest a common origin of primate vocal and nonvocal communication systems and support the notion of a gestural origin of speech and music.},

Animal culture is generally studied by either investigating transmission mechanisms experimentally, or observing patterns of behavioural variation in wild populations that cannot be explained by either genetic or environmental factors. Taking this second, ethnographic, approach, there is good evidence for cultural transmission in several cetacean species. However, only the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops) has been shown experimentally to possess sophisticated social learning abilities, including vocal and motor imitation; other species have not been studied. There is observational evidence for imitation and teaching in killer whales. For cetaceans and other large, wide-ranging animals, excessive reliance on experimental data for evidence of culture is not productive; we favour the ethnographic approach. The complex and stable vocal and behavioural cultures of sympatric groups of killer whales (Orcinus orca) appear to have no parallel outside humans, and represent an independent evolution of cultural faculties. The wide movements of cetaceans, the greater variability of the marine environment over large temporal scales relative to that on land, and the stable matrilineal social groups of some species are potentially important factors in the evolution of cetacean culture. There have been suggestions of gene-culture coevolution in cetaceans, and culture may be implicated in some unusual behavioural and life-history traits of whales and dolphins. We hope to stimulate discussion and research on culture in these animals.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent claims in neuroscience and evolutionary biology suggest that the aesthetic sense reflects preferences for image signals whose characteristics best fit innate brain mechanisms of visual recognition. Results: This hypothesis was tested by behaviourally measuring, for a set of initially unfamiliar images, the effects of category learning on preference judgements by humans, and by relating the observed data to computationally reconstructed internal representations of categorical concepts. Category learning induced complex shifts in preference behaviour. Two distinct factors complexity and bilateral symmetry - could be identified from the data as determinants of preference judgements. The effect of the complexity factor varied with object knowledge acquired through category learning. In contrast, the impact of the symmetry factor proved to be unaffected by learning experience. Computer simulations suggested that the preference for pattern complexity relies on active (top-down) mechanisms of visual recognition, whereas the preference for pattern symmetry depends on automatic (bottom-up) mechanisms. Conclusions: Human visual preferences are not fully determined by (objective) structural regularities of image stimuli but also depend on their learned (subjective) interpretation. These two aspects are reflected in distinct complementary factors underlying preference judgements, and may be related to complementary modes of visual processing in the brain.},

Revolving around the nature/nurture dichotomy, it considers the role of the dispositional machinery to respond to sounding stimuli. Conceiving of music as organized sound, it stresses the dynamic tension between music as a collection of vibrational events and their potential of being structured. This structuring, however, is not gratuitous. It depends on levels of processing that rely on evolutionary older levels of reacting to the sounds as well as higher-level functions of the brain, which allow listeners to emancipate themselves from mere acoustic processing of sounds to the level of epistemic interactions with the sounding music. These interactions are partly autonomous and partly constrained, but they all stress the realization of systemic cognition in the context of a living system`s interactions with the environment. As such, listeners can be conceived as adaptive devices, which can build up new semiotic linkages with the sounding world.},

  abstract = {Despite broad consensus on Africa as the main place of origin for anatomically modern humans, their dispersal pattern out of the continent continues to be intensely debated. In extant human populations, the observation of decreasing genetic and phenotypic diversity at increasing distances from sub-Saharan Africa has been interpreted as evidence for a single dispersal, accompanied by a series of founder effects. In such a scenario, modern human genetic and phenotypic variation was primarily generated through successive population bottlenecks and drift during a rapid worldwide expansion out of Africa in the Late Pleistocene. However, recent genetic studies, as well as accumulating archaeological and paleoanthropological evidence, challenge this parsimonious model. They suggest instead a "southern route" dispersal into Asia as early as the late Middle Pleistocene, followed by a separate dispersal into northern Eurasia. Here we test these competing out-of-Africa scenarios by modeling hypothetical geographical migration routes and assessing their correlation with neutral population differentiation, as measured by genetic polymorphisms and cranial shape variables of modern human populations from Africa and Asia. We show that both lines of evidence support a multiple-dispersals model in which Australo-Melanesian populations are relatively isolated descendants of an early dispersal, whereas other Asian populations are descended from, or highly admixed with, members of a subsequent migration event.},

We subset the cranial data into landmark configurations that include the neurocranium, the face, and the temporal bone in order to evaluate whether these cranial regions are differentially correlated to neutral genetic variation.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nResults\textbackslash nOur results show that PST, Mahalanobis, and Procrustes distances are correlated with FST distances to varying degrees. They indicate that overall cranial shape is significantly correlated with neutral genetic variation. Of the component parts examined, PST distances for both the temporal bone and the face have a stronger association with FST distances than the neurocranium. When controlling for population divergence time, only the whole cranium and the temporal bone have a statistically significant association with FST distances.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nDiscussion\textbackslash nOur results confirm that the cranium, as a whole, and the temporal bone can be used to reconstruct modern human population history.\textbackslash n},

  abstract = {The cognitive deficits present in individuals with sex chromosome aneuploidies suggest that hemispheric differentiation of function is determined by an X-Y homologous gene [Crow (1993); Lancet 342:594-598]. In particular, females with Turner's syndrome (TS) who have only one X-chromosome exhibit deficits of spatial ability whereas males with Klinefelter's syndrome (KS) who possess a supernumerary X-chromosome are delayed in acquiring words. Since spatial and verbal abilities are generally associated with right and left hemispheric function, such deficits may relate to anomalies of cerebral asymmetry. We therefore applied a novel image analysis technique to investigate the relationship between sex chromosome dosage and structural brain asymmetry. Specifically, we tested Crow's prediction that the magnitude of the brain torque (i.e., a combination of rightward frontal and leftward occipital asymmetry) would, as a function of sex chromosome dosage, be respectively decreased in TS women and increased in KS men, relative to genotypically normal controls. We found that brain torque was not significantly different in TS women and KS men, in comparison to controls. However, TS women exhibited significantly increased leftward brain asymmetry, restricted to the posterior of the brain and focused on the superior temporal and parietal-occipital association cortex, while KS men showed a trend for decreased brain asymmetry throughout the frontal lobes. The findings suggest that the number of sex chromosomes influences the development of brain asymmetry not simply to modify the torque but in a complex pattern along the antero-posterior axis.},

Measurements on the waviness and orientation of collagen, particularly at the zero-stress state, are necessary to relate the structural organization of collagen to the mechanical response of the adventitia. Using the fluorescence collagen marker CNA38-OG488 and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we imaged collagen fibers in the adventitia of rabbit common carotid arteries ex vivo. The arteries were cut open along their longitudinal axes to get the zero-stress state. We used semi-manual and automatic techniques to measure parameters related to the waviness and orientation of fibers. Our results showed that the straightness parameter (defined as the ratio between the distances of endpoints of a fiber to its length) was distributed with a beta distribution (mean value 0.72, variance 0.028) and did not depend on the mean angle orientation of fibers. Local angular density distributions revealed four axially symmetric families of fibers with mean directions of 0\textdegree, 90\textdegree, 43\textdegree{} and -43\textdegree, with respect to the axial direction of the artery, and corresponding circular standard deviations of 40\textdegree, 47\textdegree, 37\textdegree{} and 37\textdegree. The distribution of local orientations was shifted to the circumferential direction when measured in arteries at the zero-load state (intact), as compared to arteries at the zero-stress state (cut-open). Information on collagen fiber waviness and orientation, such as obtained in this study, could be used to develop structural models of the adventitia, providing better means for analyzing and understanding the mechanical properties of vascular wall.},

It has been argued that traits are not always significantly correlated to their phylogenetic history, and that correcting for phylogeny in these cases may be unnecessary and may even introduce statistical error. Statistical diagnostics to test for phylogenetic signal have recently been presented. Here, we investigate the relationship between habitat and vocal characters within a tropical bird community. We show that the bird song parameters investigated are not correlated to their phylogenetic history, indicating that certain aspects of bird song can be subject to rates of evolution that are much more rapid than speciation events. In contrast, we show that the habitat parameter is significantly correlated to its phylogenetic history. Previous comparative studies, which have not taken phylogenetic signal into account, show a significant association between habitat and song. With respect to our continuous data, we demonstrate that analyses which fail to correct for phylogeny in traits that show phylogenetic signal (i.e. habitat), or those that correct for phylogeny in traits that are phylogenetically independent (i.e. bird song parameters), support an association between habitat and song. Analyses that incorporate tests for phylogenetic signal, however, reject this association, and thus call for a re-evaluation of the evidence on correlated evolution of habitat and bird song. Therefore, using tests for phylogenetic signal before and after conducting a cross-species correlated evolution analysis is crucial to the outcome of a comparative study when analysing rapidly evolving traits.},

These symptoms are experienced as being primarily psychological (with emotional, somatic and behavioural components), their aetiology is as yet not known, their prevalence varies widely across different cultural groups, and they appear to respond to inactive placebos as effectively as to active preparations.

Evolutionary psychology goes further than this, claiming that our psychological traits\textemdash including a wide variety of traits, from mate preference and jealousy to language and reason\textemdash can be understood as specific adaptations to ancestral Pleistocene conditions. In Evolutionary Psychology as Maladapted Psychology, Robert Richardson takes a critical look at evolutionary psychology by subjecting its ambitious and controversial claims to the same sorts of methodological and evidential constraints that are broadly accepted within evolutionary biology. The claims of evolutionary psychology may pass muster as psychology; but what are their evolutionary credentials? Richardson considers three ways adaptive hypotheses can be evaluated, using examples from the biological literature to illustrate what sorts of evidence and methodology would be necessary to establish specific evolutionary and adaptive explanations of human psychological traits. He shows that existing explanations within evolutionary psychology fall woefully short of accepted biological standards. The theories offered by evolutionary psychologists may identify traits that are, or were, beneficial to humans. But gauged by biological standards, there is inadequate evidence: evolutionary psychologists are largely silent on the evolutionary evidence relevant to assessing their claims, including such matters as variation in ancestral populations, heritability, and the advantage offered to our ancestors. As evolutionary claims they are unsubstantiated. Evolutionary psychology, Richardson concludes, may offer a program of research, but it lacks the kind of evidence that is generally expected within evolutionary biology. It is speculation rather than sound science\textemdash and we should treat its claims with skepticism.},

No plant-rich intensifications are known from the Pleistocene, even from the late Pleistocene when human populations were otherwise quite sophisticated. Recent data from ice and ocean-core climate proxies show that last glacial climates were extremely hostile to agriculture\textemdash dry, low in atmospheric CO \textsubscript{2} , and extremely variable on quite short time scales. We hypothesize that agriculture was impossible under last-glacial conditions. The quite abrupt final amelioration of the climate was followed immediately by the beginnings of plant-intensive resource-use strategies in some areas, although the turn to plants was much later elsewhere. Almost all trajectories of subsistence intensification in the Holocene are progressive, and eventually agriculture became the dominant strategy in all but marginal environments. We hypothesize that, in the Holocene, agriculture was, in the long run, compulsory. We use a mathematical analysis to argue that the rate-limiting process for intensification trajectories must generally be the rate of innovation of subsistence technology or subsistence-related social organization. At the observed rates of innovation, population growth will always be rapid enough to sustain a high level of population pressure. Several processes appear to retard rates of cultural evolution below the maxima we observe in the most favorable cases. {$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Phenotypic flexibility includes systems such as individual learning, social learning, and the adaptive immune system. Since the evolution of genes by natural selection is a relatively slow process, mechanisms of phenotypic flexibility are evolved to adapt to contingencies on the time scales ranging from a few hundred milliseconds (e.g. avoidance of immediate physical threats) to a few millennia (e.g. cultural adaptations to local environmental variation in the Holocene). Because environmental variation is non-stationary and fat tailed, systems of phenotypic flexibility sometimes have to be creative. They do this by means of random innovation, or exploration, and selective retention. The canonically rational way to deal with variable, uncertain environments is the Bayesian process of using new data to update priors based on past experience. Organic evolution updates the gene frequencies of populations based upon the fitness of alleles. Learning updates behavioral priors based upon the reinforcement of alternate behaviors. Genes and mechanisms of phenotypic flexibility are not isolated but richly interact. Classically, genes are said to code for the reinforcers that shape behavior in individual learning, for example. It is currently controversial whether or not these interactions include a role for the products phenotypic flexibility directly shaping selection on genes.},

Marked inequality was observed: Gini coefficients equalled 0.96 for criminal convictions, 0.91 for public-hospital nights, 0.86 for welfare benefits, 0.74 for prescription-drug fills and 0.54 for injury-insurance claims. Marked aggregation was uncovered: a small population segment accounted for a disproportionate share of use-events and costs across multiple sectors. These findings were replicated in 2.3 million Danes. We then integrated the New Zealand databases with the four-decade-long Dunedin Study. The high-need/high-cost population segment experienced early-life factors that reduce workforce readiness, including low education and poor mental health. In midlife they reported low life satisfaction. Investing in young people's education and training potential could reduce health and social inequalities and enhance population wellbeing.}

He considered the ability to produce musical notes without direct use the most mysterious endowment of mankind. Bird song is attributed to sexual selection, but it remains unknown how the expected relationship between melodic performance and phenotypic quality arises. Melodies consist of sequences of notes, and both Pythagoras andmusic theorists in the Middle Ages found that their tonal frequencies form simple ratios that correspond to small-integer proportions derived from the harmonic series. Harmonics are acoustically predictable, and thus form the basis of the natural, just tuning system in music. Here I analyze the songs of the great tit (Parus major), a bird with a ste- reotyped song of typically two notes, and test the prediction that the deviations of the intervals from small-integer frequency ratios based on the harmonic series are related to the quality of the singer. I showthat the birds with the smallest deviations fromsmall-integer ratios possess the largest melanin-based black ventral tie, a signal that has been demonstrated to indicate social status and domi- nance, past exposure to parasites, and reproductive potential. The singing of notes with exact frequency relationships requires high levels of motor control and auditory sensory feedback. The finding provides a missing link between melodic precision and phenotypic quality of individuals, which is key for understanding the evolution of vocal melodic expression in animals, and elucidates pathways for the evolution of melodic expression in music.},

Not only can the classic work on song learning in chaffinches by Thorpe and Marler be said to have kick-started the field of vocal learning and traditions in animals, but subsequent work in this species has provided an exceptional depth and breadth of data on geographic variation in song and its cultural evolution. Here we review the work on chaffinch song that has been carried out in the 60 or so years since Thorpe and Marler's pioneering studies. In addition to further work on vocal learning and on dialects, the chaffinch has become a prime subject for studies of cultural evolution, particularly through studies on the Atlantic islands, as well as in Britain, Europe, and New Zealand. As well as describing such studies, we identify further areas likely to be fruitful for research on this species, which remains one of the icons of bird song research.},

In rodents, acoustic signals used in reproductive contexts are produced by two distinct mechanisms, but the underlying anatomy that facilitates such divergence is poorly understood. 'Audible' vocalizations with spectral properties between 500 Hz and 16 kHz are thought to be produced by flow-induced vocal fold vibrations, whereas 'ultrasonic' vocalizations with fundamental frequencies above 19 kHz are produced by an aerodynamic whistle mechanism. Baiomyine mice (genus \emph{Baiomys} and \emph{Scotinomys}) produce complex frequency modulated songs that span these traditional distinctions and represent important models to understand the evolution of signal elaboration. We combined acoustic analyses of spontaneously vocalizing northern pygmy mice (\emph{B. taylori}) mice in air and light gas atmosphere with morphometric analyses of their vocal apparatus to infer the mechanism of vocal production. Increased fundamental frequencies in heliox indicated that pygmy mouse songs are produced by an aerodynamic whistle mechanism supported by the presence of a ventral pouch and alar cartilage. Comparative analyses of the larynx and ventral pouch size among four additional ultrasonic whistle-producing rodents indicate that the unusually low 'ultrasonic' frequencies (relative to body size) of pygmy mice songs are associated with an enlarged ventral pouch. Additionally, mice produced shorter syllables while maintaining intersyllable interval duration, thereby increasing syllable repetition rates. We conclude that while laryngeal anatomy sets the foundation for vocal frequency range, variation and adjustment of central vocal motor control programs fine tunes spectral and temporal characters to promote acoustic diversity within and between species.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Sequence learning is a vital cognitive function and has been observed in numerous brain areas. Discovering the algorithms underlying sequence learning has been a major endeavor in both neuroscience and machine learning. In earlier work, we showed that by constraining the sparsity of the emission matrix of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in a biologically-plausible manner we are able to efficiently learn higher-order temporal dependencies and recognize contexts in noisy signals. The central basis of our model, referred to as the Cloned HMM (CHMM), is the observation that cortical neurons sharing the same receptive field properties can learn to represent unique incidences of bottom-up information within different temporal contexts. CHMMs can efficiently learn higher-order temporal dependencies, recognize long-range contexts and, unlike recurrent neural networks, are able to natively handle uncertainty. In this paper we introduce a biologically plausible CHMM learning algorithm, memorize-generalize, that can rapidly memorize sequences as they are encountered, and gradually generalize as more data is accumulated. We demonstrate that CHMMs trained with the memorize generalize algorithm can model long-range structure in bird songs with only a slight degradation in performance compared to expectation maximization, while still outperforming other representations.}

  abstract = {Song plays an important role in avian communication and acoustic variation is important at both the individual and population level. Habitat-related variation between populations in particular can reflect adaptations to the environment accumulated over generations, but this may not always be the case. In this study, we test whether variation between individuals matches local conditions with respect to noise level and territory density to examine whether short-term flexibility could contribute to song divergence at the population level. We conducted a case study on an urban and forest population of the European blackbird and show divergence at the population level (i. e. across habitats) in blackbird song, anthropogenic noise level and territory density. Unlike in several other species, we found a lack of any correlation at the individual level (i. e. across individuals) between song features and ambient noise. This suggests species-specific causal explanations for noise-dependent song differentiation which are likely associated with variation in song-copying behaviour or feedback constraints related to variable singing styles. On the other hand, we found that at the level of individual territories, temporal features, but not spectral ones, are correlated to territory density and seasonality. This suggests that short-term individual variation can indeed contribute to habitat-dependent divergence at the population level. As this may undermine the potential role for song as a population marker, we conclude that more investigations on individual song flexibility are required for a better understanding of the impact of population-level song divergence on hybridisation and speciation. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2009.},

However, the considerable size of sophisticated biologging devices restricts their application to larger animals, while old-fashioned techniques still represent the state-of-the-art for studying small vertebrates. In industrial applications, low-power wireless sensor networks fulfill requirements similar to those needed to monitor animal behavior at high resolution and at low tag weight. We created a wireless biologging network (WBN), which enables simultaneous direct proximity sensing, high-resolution tracking and long-range remote data download at tag weights of one to two grams. Deployments to study wild bats created data of unprecedented quality and demonstrate the high potential of WBNs for studying (social) behavior. Our developments highlight the vast capabilities of WBNs and their potential to close an important gap in biologging: fully automated tracking and proximity sensing of small animals, even in closed habitats, at high spatial and temporal resolution.}

We present a computational model of the evolutionary history of the Bengalese finch which demonstrates how an increase in song complexity and increased influence from early learning could evolve spontaneously as a result of domestication. We argue that this may provide an insight into how increased reliance on vocal learning could evolve in other communication systems, including human language.},

In this paper we formally model this hypothesis for the first time, presenting a population genetic model that takes into account both the evolution of genetic learning preferences and cultural transmission of song. The models demonstrate that a preference for song types that reveal developmental stress can evolve in a population, and that cultural transmission of these song types can be stable, lending more support to the hypothesis. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Variation in the expression of sexually selected traits is thought to reflect variation in male genetic and/or phenotypic quality. Vocal amplitude is a song parameter that has received little attention in the context of sexual selection, but there is some evidence that the intensity of bird song affects female preferences. Here, we tested whether the amplitude of broadcast song plays a role in malemale competition. We used song playback with varying song amplitude (within the natural amplitude range of the species) and a dummy bird taxidermy to simulate territorial intrusions in the great tit, Parus major, during the fertile period of the female and measured the response of the local male. The results show that playback amplitude significantly affected the subjects behaviour: after approaching to within 25 m around the loudspeaker, territorial males stayed longer within that perimeter after the playback of high-amplitude songs compared with low-amplitude songs. Our findings add to the small but growing body of evidence suggesting that vocal amplitude may be a sexually selected song trait.},

Although birdsong has been studied for many years, it has only recently been suggested that it is a multifaceted signal that could encompass multiple sexually selected traits. According to the theories on the evolution and maintenance of multiple sexually selected signals, the different components of birdsong may signal multiple, redundant or unreliable information on male quality. We used a cross-sectional approach to examine whether the expression of song in the great tit was differentially related to any of three measures of quality: age, condition and survival. We analysed several informative characteristics in great tit song concerning diversity, output, performance and consistency to see whether different traits were simultaneously related to the studied quality parameters, or if, in contrast, each song trait was related to only one of the measures of quality. Song consistency and repertoire size were strongly related to only one of the studied parameters (age and survival, respectively), indicating that different song traits signal specific quality characteristics, and providing, therefore, evidence to support the multiple-signal hypothesis. Moreover, measures of song performance and song output (phrase and strophe rate) correlated positively with repertoire size, which might indicate that, at the same time, great tit song is signalling redundant information. In addition, some song characteristics did not correlate with any of the quality parameters measured, suggesting that those song traits might provide unreliable information. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Variation in birdsong among populations can be influenced by habitat fragmentation and might affect successful dispersal among habitat fragments. We studied variation in great tit song in a long-term study population distributed over nine forest fragments. All individual males recorded had a known dispersal history within the fragmented forest habitat. We found spatial structure of declining song-type sharing with distance, with a marked drop from an individual's own forest fragment to another across a habitat gap. We also found decreasing song similarity among increasingly distant fragments in terms of temporal and spectral characteristics of shared song types. The change in acoustic structure was more gradual and seemed less affected by habitat discontinuity but also showed a tight correlation with dispersal index among forest fragments. Immigrant birds shared fewer song types with neighbouring birds that were born within the same forest fragment, but not less compared to birds born in another forest fragment within the study area. Our data provide detailed insight into the relationship between song differentiation and male dispersal and contribute to our understanding of the potential role of song in reproductive exchange and avian speciation. The fact that birds in small forest fragments shared more songs than birds in larger forest fragments confirms that song analysis has potential as a tool for conservation in rare species.},

  abstract = {There is a remarkable diversity of song-learning strategies in songbirds. Establishing whether a species is closed- or open-ended is important to be able to interpret functional and evolutionary consequences of variation in repertoire size. Most of our knowledge regarding the timing of vocal learning is based on laboratory studies, despite the fact that these may not always replicate the complex ecological and social interactions experienced by birds in the wild. Given that field studies cannot provide the experimental control of laboratory studies, it may not be surprising that species such as the great tit that were initially assumed to be closed-ended learners have later been suggested to be open-ended learners. By using an established colour-ringed population, by following a standardized recording protocol, and by taking into account the species' song ecology (using only recordings obtained during peak of singing at dawn), we replicated two previous studies to assess song repertoire learning and flexibility in adult wild great tits elicited by social interactions. First, we performed a playback experiment to test repertoire plasticity elicited by novel versus own songs. Additionally, in a longitudinal study, we followed 30 males in two consecutive years and analysed whether new neighbours influenced any change in the repertoire. Contrary to the previous studies, song repertoire size and composition were found to be highly repeatable both between years and after confrontation with a novel song. Our results suggest that great tits are closed-ended learners and that their song repertoire probably does not change during adulthood. Methodological differences that may have led to an underestimation of the repertoires or population differences may explain the discrepancy in results with previous studies. We argue that a rigorous and standardized assessment of the repertoire is essential when studying age- or playback-induced changes in repertoire size and composition under field conditions.},

While maturation is usually considered as a measure of individual quality, senescence is associated with loss of function and physiological deterioration. To date, little is known about age-dependent expression of acoustic sexually selected traits over a lifetime. Using a free-living population of great tits, . Parus major, we recorded the song of individually marked males in a standardized way during a 4-year period, in a longitudinal design. The study focused on two previously identified, acoustic, sexually selected signals: song consistency and repertoire size. Young (1-2 years old) and old (5-6 years old) individuals expressed lower song consistency than individuals at intermediate age (3-4 years old), suggesting song tuning during the first 3 years of life, and deterioration after the peak is reached. Repertoire size, in contrast, did not vary with age. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate song changes at advanced age and to report senescence effects on song expression in free-living songbirds. Our results suggest that, similarly to speech in humans, different aspects of birdsong are differentially affected by age: while motor performance traits (song consistency) deteriorate with age, language skills (repertoire size) may not be affected during the life span. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Most of what we know about the life-history patterns and social structure of gorillas comes from studies of eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei sp.), which live under dramatically different ecological conditions compared to western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla sp.). In this paper we present new data on western gorilla social structure and life histories from four study sites, and make comparisons with eastern gorilla populations. Data were obtained from two study sites with gorilla groups undergoing the habituation process (Lossi, Democratic Republic of Congo and Bai Hokou, Central African Republic) and two "bai" studies (Maya Nord and Mbeli Bai, Republic of Congo). The size and structure of these groups were similar to those seen in eastern gorillas. However, differences in the occurrence of various group transitions (group formations, changes between one-male and multimale composition, and group disintegrations) exist, and western gorillas notably exhibit much higher rates of male emigration and correspondingly fewer multimale groups compared to mountain gorillas. Certain phenomena have been observed only rarely, including predation by leopards. The preliminary data show no significant differences in birth rates between western gorillas and mountain gorillas. The ecological variability across gorilla habitats likely explains the flexibility in the social system of gorillas, but we need more information on the social relationships and ecology of western gorillas to elucidate the causes for the similarities and differences between western and eastern gorillas on the levels of individuals, social groups, and population dynamics.},

  abstract = {2nd ed. This volume contains forty-seven original essays by seventy leading researchers, offering an overview of all major areas of primatology. Arranged in six sections, the text begins with an introduction to primatology and a review of the natural history of the major taxonomic groups within the order Primates. It goes on to cover methodologies and research design for both field and captive settings; primate reproduction; primate ecology and conservation and their roles in the daily lives of primates; and such aspects of social behavior and intelligence as communication, learning, and cognition. The volume ends with a concluding chapter by the editors that discuss the future of primatological research. pt. 1 : Background.

  abstract = {Animals learn many complex behaviors by emulating the behavior of more experienced individuals. This essential, yet still poorly understood, form of learning relies on the ability to encode lasting memories of observed behaviors. We identified a vocal-motor pathway in the zebra finch where memories that guide learning of song-element durations can be implanted. Activation of synapses in this pathway seeds memories that guide learning of song-element duration and can override learning from social interactions with other individuals. Genetic lesions of this circuit after memory formation, however, do not disrupt subsequent song imitation, which suggests that these memories are stored at downstream synapses. Thus, activity at these sensorimotor synapses can bypass learning from auditory and social experience and embed memories that guide learning of song timing.}

These seek relationships between demographic variables and cultural traits from large, cross-cultural datasets. The insights from these studies are important for understanding how cultural traits evolve. While these studies are fascinating and are good at generating testable hypotheses, they may underestimate the probability of finding spurious correlations between cultural traits. Here we show that this kind of approach can find links between such unlikely cultural traits as traffic accidents, levels of extra-martial sex, political collectivism and linguistic diversity. This suggests that spurious correlations, due to historical descent, geographic diffusion or increased noise-to-signal ratios in large datasets, are much more likely than some studies admit. We suggest some criteria for the evaluation of nomothetic studies and some practical solutions to the problems. Since some of these studies are receiving media attention without a widespread understanding of the complexities of the issue, there is a risk that poorly controlled studies could affect policy. We hope to contribute towards a general skepticism for correlational studies by demonstrating the ease of finding apparently rigorous correlations between cultural traits. Despite this, we see well-controlled nomothetic studies as useful tools for the development of theories.},

It remains unknown whether the strength of sexual selection on song characteristics, such as repertoire size, affects adult song plasticity, or whether adult song plasticity affects song evolution. Here, we compiled data about song plasticity, song characteristics, and mating system and then examined evolutionary interactions between these traits. Across 67 species, we found that lineages with adult song plasticity show directional evolution toward increased syllable and song repertoires, while several other song characteristics evolved faster, but in a non-directional manner. Song plasticity appears to drive bi-directional transitions between monogamous and polygynous social mating systems. Notably, our analysis of correlated evolution suggests that extreme syllable and song repertoire sizes drive the evolution of adult song plasticity or stability, providing novel evidence that sexual selection may indirectly influence open- versus closed-ended learning.},

  abstract = {Birdsong has long been considered a sexually selected trait that relays honest information about male quality, and laboratory studies generally suggest that female songbirds prefer larger repertoires. However, analysis of field studies across species surprisingly revealed a weak correlation between song elaboration and reproductive success, and it remains unknown why only certain species show this correlation in nature. Taken together, these studies suggest that females in numerous species can detect and prefer larger repertoires in a laboratory setting, but larger individual repertoires correlate with reproductive success only in a subset of these species. This prompts the question: Do the species that show a stronger correlation between reproductive success and larger individual repertoires in nature have anything in common? In this study, we test whether between-species differences in two song-related variables\textemdash species average syllable repertoire size and adult song stability over time\textemdash can be used to predict the importance of individual song elaboration in reproductive success within a species. Our cross-species meta-analysis of field studies revealed that species with larger average syllable repertoire sizes exhibited a stronger correlation between individual elaboration and reproductive success than species with smaller syllable repertoires. Song stability versus plasticity in adulthood provided little predictive power on its own, suggesting that the putative correlation between repertoire size and age in open-ended learners does not explain the association between song elaboration and reproductive success.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic noise has been shown to alter the transmission environment and distort acoustic signals, prompting vocalizing species to use compensatory mechanisms. Through a meta-analysis we investigated the relative importance of biological and contextual factors predisposing species to shift their singing/calling frequencies in response to anthropogenic noise. We gathered data from 36 studies, synthesizing information on more than 160 experiments and 60 bird and anuran species. To estimate the breadth of frequency shift, we calculated a standardized effect size using Hedges' g. We fitted a multilevel linear mixed-effect model on g as the dependent variable weighted by its inverse variance, with typical frequency, body mass, experimental condition, and noise source type as independent terms. Our results reveal broader shifts in smaller bird species when compared with bigger species, an effect that was emphasized in the low-frequency component of the song spectrum. Birds increased their dominant frequencies when confronted to anthropogenic noise, whereas anurans were less prone to such shifts. Human-altered acoustic environments can be considered a novel selective force impelling change to the communication patterns of many vocalizing species.},

  abstract = {The Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most frequent sex chromosomal disorder in males, characterized by at least one supernumerary X chromosome (most frequent karyotype 47,XXY). This syndrome presents with a broad range of phenotypes. The common characteristics include small testes and infertility, but KS subjects are at increased risk of hypogonadism, cognitive dysfunction, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and autoimmune disorders, which are present in variable proportion. Although part of the clinical variability might be linked to a different degree of testicular function observed in KS patients, genetic mechanisms of the supernumerary X chromosome might contribute. Gene-dosage effects and parental origin of the supernumerary X chromosome have been suggested to this regard. No study has been performed analyzing the genetic constitution of the X chromosome in terms of copy number variations (CNVs) and their possible involvement in phenotype of KS. To this aim, we performed a SNP arrays analysis on 94 KS and 85 controls. We found that KS subjects have more frequently than controls X-linked CNVs (39/94, [41.5\%] with respect to 12/42, [28.6\%] of females, and 8/43, [18.6\%] of males, p {$<$} 0.01). The number of X-linked CNVs in KS patients was 4.58 +/- 1.92 CNVs/subject, significantly higher with respect to that found in control females (1.50 +/- 1.29 CNVs/subject) and males (1.14 +/- 0.37 CNVs/subject). Importantly, 94.4\% X-linked CNVs in KS subjects were duplications, higher with respect to control males (50.0\%, p {$<$} 0.001) and females (83.3\%, p = 0.1). Half of the X-linked CNVs fell within regions encompassing genes and most of them (90\%) included genes escaping X-inactivation in the regions of X-Y homology, particularly in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) and Xq21.31. This study described for the first time the genetic properties of the X chromosome in KS and suggests that X-linked CNVs (especially duplications) might contribute to the clinical phenotype.},

Insect pollinators preferentially visit flowers of a particular symmetry type, thus leading to the suggestion that they have innate preferences for symmetrical flowers or flower models. Here we show that flower-na\"ive bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), with no experience of symmetric or asymmetric patterns and whose visual experience was accurately controlled, have innate preferences for bilateral symmetry. The presence of color cues did not influence the bees' original preference. Our results thus show that bilateral symmetry is innately preferred in the context of food search, a fact that supports the selection of symmetry in flower displays. Furthermore, such innate preferences indicate that the nervous system of na\"ive animals may be primed to respond to relevant sensory cues in the environment.},

  abstract = {The timing of acoustic events is central to human speech and music. Tempo tends to be slower in aesthetic contexts: rates in poetic speech and music are slower than non-poetic, running speech. We tested whether a general \emph{aesthetic} preference for slower rates can account for this, using birdsong as a stimulus: it structurally resembles human sequences but is unbiased by their production or processing constraints. When listeners selected the birdsong playback tempo that was most pleasing, they showed no bias towards any range of note rates. However, upon hearing a novel stimulus, listeners rapidly formed a robust, implicit memory of its temporal properties, and developed a stimulus-specific preference for the memorized tempo. Interestingly, \emph{tempo perception} in birdsong stimuli was strongly determined by individual, internal preferences for rates of 1\textendash 2 Hz. This suggests that processing complex sound sequences relies on a default time window, while aesthetic appreciation appears flexible, experience-based and not determined by absolute event rates.}

  abstract = {Music is thought to engage its listeners by driving feelings of surprise, tension, and relief through a dynamic mixture of predictable and unpredictable patterns, a property summarized here as "expressiveness". Birdsong shares with music the goal to attract its listeners' attention and might use similar strategies to achieve this. We here tested a thrush nightingale's (Luscinia luscinia) rhythm, as represented by song amplitude envelope (containing information on note timing, duration, and intensity), for evidence of expressiveness. We used multifractal analysis, which is designed to detect in a signal dynamic fluctuations between predictable and unpredictable states on multiple timescales (e.g. notes, subphrases, songs). Results show that rhythm is strongly multifractal, indicating fluctuations between predictable and unpredictable patterns. Moreover, comparing original songs with re-synthesized songs that lack all subtle deviations from the "standard" note envelopes, we find that deviations in note intensity and duration significantly contributed to multifractality. This suggests that birdsong is more dynamic due to subtle note timing patterns, often similar to musical operations like accelerando or crescendo. While different sources of these dynamics are conceivable, this study shows that multi-timescale rhythm fluctuations can be detected in birdsong, paving the path to studying mechanisms and function behind such patterns.},

  abstract = {Rhythm is a prominent feature of music. Of the infinite possible ways of organizing events in time, musical rhythms are almost always distributed categorically. Such categories can facilitate the transmission of culture\textemdash a feature that songbirds and humans share. We compared rhythms of live performances of music to rhythms of wild thrush nightingale and domestic zebra finch songs. In nightingales, but not in zebra finches, we found universal rhythm categories, with patterns that were surprisingly similar to those of music. Isochronous 1:1 rhythms were similarly common. Interestingly, a bias toward small ratios (around 1:2 to 1:3), which is highly abundant in music, was observed also in thrush nightingale songs. Within that range, however, there was no statistically significant bias toward exact integer ratios (1:2 or 1:3) in the birds. High-ratio rhythms were abundant in the nightingale song and are structurally similar to fusion rhythms (ornaments) in music. In both species, preferred rhythms remained invariant over extended ranges of tempos, indicating natural categories. The number of rhythm categories decreased at higher tempos, with a threshold above which rhythm became highly stereotyped. In thrush nightingales, this threshold occurred at a tempo twice faster than in humans, indicating weaker structural constraints and a remarkable motor proficiency. Together, the results suggest that categorical rhythms reflect similar constraints on learning motor skills across species. The saliency of categorical rhythms across humans and thrush nightingales suggests that they promote, or emerge from, the cultural transmission of learned vocalizations. Video Abstract: [Figure presented] Comparing rhythm between music and birdsong, Roeske, Tchernichovski et al. report that some songbirds' rhythms are categorical, like musical rhythms across cultures. Across species and cultures, the categories overlap but are not identical. Categorical rhythm may promote (or emerge from) cultural transmission of learned vocalizations.},

In animal societies, there is increased interest in understanding variation in the effects of modularity on transmission as it may provide important insight into a given network's performance, in addition to the evolutionary consequences the structure of the network may have for individual fitness. Yet, to our knowledge, the degree to which network efficiency is modularity dependent has not yet been investigated in great detail in behavioral and evolutionary ecology. Here, we investigated to what degree network efficiency, as a proxy for social transmission, is modularity dependent. We created 2798 networks varying in group size and density, and tested whether network structure (density, Newman's modularity, eigenvector centralization) and group size shape network efficiency. We also used published data from 41 primate social networks to test whether the predictions generated in our simulations were supported by empirical observations. Our results show a non-linear relationship between modularity and global efficiency, with the latter peaking at intermediate values of modularity in both theoretical and empirical networks. This phenomenon may have relevance for observed variation in social structure and its link with network performance. Our results may thus provide a basis from which to discuss the evolution of complex systems such as animal societies.{$<$}/p{$>$}                                                                 {$<$}h3 class="a-plus-plus"{$>$}Significance statement{$<$}/h3{$>$}                       {$<$}p class="a-plus-plus"{$>$}Networks may maximize performance and minimize transmission costs, as demonstrated in neural networks, but to what degree network efficiency is modularity dependent has not yet been investigated in behavioral ecology. We provide evidence that modularity, such as subgrouping in animal networks, can have non-linear effects on transmission processes, with low values of modularity tending to positively influence social transmission and high values tending to negatively influence transmission. This pattern was consistent across small, medium, and large social groups from theoretical networks, and was corroborated by our empirical networks which were derived from 41 small- to medium-sized groups of 15 primate species. These results have potential implications for the understanding of social flexibility and its link with network performance, in addition informing many interdisciplinary fields, such as communication and computer science.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Over the past decade, a major debate has taken place on the underpinnings of cultural changes in human societies. A growing array of evidence in behavioural and evolutionary biology has revealed that social connectivity among populations and within them affects, and is affected by, culture. Yet the interplay between prehistoric hunter\textendash gatherer social structure and cultural transmission has typically been overlooked. Interestingly, the archaeological record contains large data sets, allowing us to track cultural changes over thousands of years: they thus offer a unique opportunity to shed light on long-term cultural transmission processes. In this review, we demonstrate how well-developed methods for social structure analysis can increase our understanding of the selective pressures underlying cumulative culture. We propose a multilevel analytical framework that considers finer aspects of the complex social structure in which regional groups of prehistoric hunter\textendash gatherers were embedded. We put forward predictions of cultural transmission based on local- and global-level network metrics of small-scale societies and their potential effects on cumulative culture. By bridging the gaps between network science, palaeodemography and cultural evolution, we draw attention to the use of the archaeological record to depict patterns of social interactions and transmission variability. We argue that this new framework will contribute to improving our understanding of social interaction patterns, as well as the contexts in which cultural changes occur. Ultimately, this may provide insights into the evolution of human behaviour.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Background: The human menstrual cycle (MC) has historically been the focus of myth and misinformation, leading to ideas that constrain women's activities. Objectives: We wished to examine one pervasive idea, that the MC is a cause of negative mood, by studying the scientific literature as a whole. We briefly reviewed the history of the idea of premenstrual syndrome and undertook a systematic review of quality studies. Methods: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and article bibliographies for published studies using non-help-seeking samples with daily mood data collected prospectively for a minimum of 1 complete MC. We critiqued their methodologies and tabulated the key findings. Results: Of 47 English language studies identified, 18 (38.3\%) found no association of mood with any MC phase; 18 found an association of negative mood in the premenstrual phase combined with another MC phase; and only 7 (14.9\%) found an association of negative mood and the premenstrual phase. Finally, the remaining 4 studies (8.5\%) showed an association between negative mood and a non-premenstrual phase. Considering the only 41 adequately powered studies, the same phase links were reported by 36.6\%, 41.5\%, and 13.5\% of studies, respectively. Their diversity of methods (sampling, instruments, and cycle phase definitions) precluded a meta-analysis. Conclusions: Taken together, these studies failed to provide clear evidence in support of the existence of a specific premenstrual negative mood syndrome in the general population. This puzzlingly widespread belief needs challenging, as it perpetuates negative concepts linking female reproduction with negative emotionality. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Female bird song has been underappreciated and understudied, especially in temperate species. Birdsong was originally thought to be a trait used primarily by male songbirds for mate attraction and male/male contest. However, ornithologists have long known that females sing in many tropical songbirds, often for similar functions to male song. Yet, studies of female song in temperate regions remain scarce. Increasing our understanding of the function of female song in temperate species is a powerful step towards discerning the selective pressures that maintain elaborate female signals. In the last few decades, studies of temperate species have highlighted five major functional categories of female song. Using a modeling framework, based on all known functions of song in other species, we tested the function of female song in eastern bluebirds. The modeling framework allowed us to test the effect of multiple complex behaviors simultaneously to predict female song function. Additionally, modeling mitigated issues of multiple testing across the five different functional categories. We found that female song in eastern bluebirds is primarily used in pair communication. Specifically, females sing to strengthen and maintain long-term pair bonds. Strengthening pair-bonds may be advantageous for eastern bluebirds as pairs that remain together between nesting attempts and between years have higher reproductive success. We demonstrate a clear link between the function of female song in pair communication and the likely selective force of long-term pair bonds acting on eastern bluebird reproductive success. Additionally, our study highlights a major function of female song in a temperate species.}

Previously, however, the fields of behaviour, ecology and evolution generally have been restricted to evaluating differences between statistical distributions. This framework can be very powerful. Unfortunately, it has also created a bias in these, and many other, fields towards publications focusing only on phenomena for which there are statistically significant differences. However, there is a wide range of questions that would benefit from reversing the existing paradigm and testing, instead, for equivalence. We have adapted the two one-sided test (TOST), also known as equivalence testing, from pharmaceutical science to be applicable to behavioural and ecological studies. We created a repeated measures analysis that allows researchers to statistically examine similarities between distributions. We compared song structure in male and female eastern bluebirds, {$<$}em{$>$}Sialia sialis{$<$}/em{$>$}, as a case study for this method. We failed to find significant differences between male and female songs via a more traditional test, repeated measures ANOVA. Therefore, no definitive conclusion could be drawn about the similarities or differences in song structure. However, our repeated measures equivalence test showed that, based on five standard measures of song variation, male and female eastern bluebirds sing statistically equivalent songs. Our study highlights the presence of complex female song in a temperate songbird species. Additionally, we provide a new statistical test useful for expanding the statistical toolbox to assess new behavioural and ecological questions, and to help counteract publication bias in our fields.{$<$}/p{$><$}/div{$><$}/div{$>$}}

Overall, among-population differences in extant Homo sapiens cranial morphology are proportional to among-population differences in neutral molecular characteristics. For most of the populations studied, cranial morphology varies among regions in a manner consistent with neutral expectations. Removal of the effects of shared population history and structure by using the partial Mantel's test, however, does not remove the correlation between some aspects of cranial morphology and a measure of coldness of climate. The excess differentiation is most apparent in those population comparisons that involve a Siberian population living in an extremely cold environment. This finding suggests the action of natural selection, associated with regional variation in temperature, leading to among-population differentiation in excess of neutral expectations for some cranial dimensions. Those dimensions reflect the breadth of the skull, cranial vault size and shape, and aspects of nasal morphology. Although morphology for most of the world appears to vary among populations in accordance with neutral expectations in the context of population structure and history, morphology of the Siberian population appears to have undergone adaptation by natural selection.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study assesses the extent to which relationships among groups complicate comparative studies of adaptation in recent human cranial variation and the extent to which departures from neutral additive models of evolution hinder the reconstruction of population relationships among groups using cranial morphology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a maximum likelihood evolutionary model fitting approach and a mixed population genomic and cranial data set, I evaluate the relative fits of several widely used models of human cranial evolution. Moreover, I compare the goodness of fit of models of cranial evolution constrained by genomic variation to test hypotheses about population specific departures from neutrality. RESULTS: Models from population genomics are much better fits to cranial variation than are traditional models from comparative human biology. There is not enough evolutionary information in the cranium to reconstruct much of recent human evolution but the influence of population history on cranial variation is strong enough to cause comparative studies of adaptation serious difficulties. Deviations from a model of random genetic drift along a tree-like population history show the importance of environmental effects, gene flow, and/or natural selection on human cranial variation. Moreover, there is a strong signal of the effect of natural selection or an environmental factor on a group of humans from Siberia. DISCUSSION: The evolution of the human cranium is complex and no one evolutionary process has prevailed at the expense of all others. A holistic unification of phenome, genome, and environmental context, gives us a strong point of purchase on these problems, which is unavailable to any one traditional approach alone.

Women expressed significantly more fear of these species than did men, and expressed fear increased with age in both sexes. Human population density had very little effect on the degree of self-reported fear of large carnivores, but people living in rural areas with one carnivore species in their vicinity expressed less fear of this species than people from rural areas where this carnivore species was absent. Activities related to experience with, or knowledge of, the large carnivores also effected fear patterns. People with higher education and those who expressed interest in outdoor activities like small game hunting and mountain hiking generally reported less fear than did respondents with lower education and no interest in outdoor activities, respectively. We argue that a good management strategy is to develop educational programs where people learn about the biology and habits of the large carnivores and are encouraged to gain first-hand outdoor experience in areas with large carnivores \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

  abstract = {The human X chromosome has a unique biology that was shaped by its evolution as the sex chromosome shared by males and females. We have determined 99.3\% of the euchromatic sequence of the X chromosome. Our analysis illustrates the autosomal origin of the mammalian sex chromosomes, the stepwise process that led to the progressive loss of recombination between X and Y, and the extent of subsequent degradation of the Y chromosome. LINE1 repeat elements cover one-third of the X chromosome, with a distribution that is consistent with their proposed role as way stations in the process of X-chromosome inactivation. We found 1,098 genes in the sequence, of which 99 encode proteins expressed in testis and in various tumour types. A disproportionately high number of mendelian diseases are documented for the X chromosome. Of this number, 168 have been explained by mutations in 113 X-linked genes, which in many cases were characterized with the aid of the DNA sequence.},

  abstract = {Turner syndrome (TS) is a human genetic disorder involving females who lack all or part of one X chromosome. The complex phenotype includes ovarian failure, a characteristic neurocognitive profile and typical physical features. TS features are associated not only with complete monosomy X but also with partial deletions of either the short (Xp) or long (Xq) arm (partial monosomy X). Impaired visual-spatial/perceptual abilities are characteristic of TS children and adults of varying races and socioeconomic status, but global developmental delay is uncommon. The cognitive phenotype generally includes normal verbal function with relatively impaired visual-spatial ability, attention, working memory, and spatially dependent executive function. The constellation of neurocognitive deficits observed in TS is most likely multifactorial and related to a complex interaction between genetic abnormalities and hormonal deficiencies. Furthermore, other determinants, including an additional genetic mechanism, imprinting, may also contribute to cognitive deficits associated with monosomy X. As a relatively common genetic disorder with well-defined manifestations, TS presents an opportunity to investigate genetic and hormonal factors that influence female cognitive development. TS is an excellent model for such studies because of its prevalence, the well-characterized phenotype, and the wealth of molecular resources available for the X chromosome. In the current review, we summarize the hormonal and genetic factors that may contribute to the TS neurocognitive phenotype. The hormonal determinants of cognition in TS are related to estrogen and androgen deficiency. Our genetic hypothesis is that haploinsufficiency for gene/genes on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp) is responsible for the hallmark features of the TS cognitive phenotype. Careful clinical and molecular characterization of adult subjects missing part of Xp links the TS phenotype of impaired visual spatial/perceptual ability to specific distal Xp chromosome regions. We demonstrate that small, nonmosaic deletion of the distal short arm of the X chromosome in adult women is associated with the same hallmark cognitive profile seen in adult women with TS. Future studies will elucidate the cognitive deficits and the underlying etiology. These results should allow us to begin to design cognitive interventions that might lessen those deficits in the TS population.},

  abstract = {Intelligence has evolved many times independently among vertebrates. Primates, elephants and cetaceans are assumed to be more intelligent than 'lower' mammals, the great apes and humans more than monkeys, and humans more than the great apes. Brain properties assumed to be relevant for intelligence are the (absolute or relative) size of the brain, cortex, prefrontal cortex and degree of encephalization. However, factors that correlate better with intelligence are the number of cortical neurons and conduction velocity, as the basis for information-processing capacity. Humans have more cortical neurons than other mammals, although only marginally more than whales and elephants. The outstanding intelligence of humans appears to result from a combination and enhancement of properties found in non-human primates, such as theory of mind, imitation and language, rather than from 'unique' properties. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In contrast to most birds, nestling barn owls (Tyto alba) vocalise not only when parents are at the nest but also in their absence. Calls produced in their absence have been shown to facilitate sibling negotiation over the impending food resource. Since nestlings vocalise more vigorously in the presence of parents, they may be calling not to negotiate resources but to compete amongst each other over parental food distribution. A critical issue is to determine whether offspring need differentially affects sibling negotiation and sibling competition, that is vocalisation in the absence and presence of parents. To answer this question, I manipulated the food supply of 26 broods by adding or removing prey items. In the absence of parents, food-added broods vocalised at a significantly lower level than food-removed ones. In contrast, once a parent arrived at the nest, the vocalisation level was not significantly related to the manipulation of brood food supply. This suggests that in the absence of parents, it is more important for food-removed nestlings to vocalise intensely, and that in their presence, the relationship between begging and offspring need tends to vanish. In other words, brood food supply may affect sibling negotiation to a larger extent than sibling competition.},

  abstract = {Despite the potential reproductive benefits of extrapair matings, extrapair paternity rates in many avian species often vary greatly among populations. Although ecological factors have been shown to influence intraspecific patterns of extrapair paternity in some species, for cooperatively breeding species living in family groups, social/demographic factors may also play a role. This study examined how ecological factors related to territory quality (vegetation cover, insect abundance) and social/demographic factors (group size, number of breeding pairs, genetic relatedness) influenced intraspecific patterns of extrapair paternity in cooperatively breeding superb starlings, Lamprotornis superbus. Superb starlings inhabit spatiotemporally variable African savannas where high temporal variability drives reproductive decisions (adoption of breeding roles, offspring sex allocation) and where territories suitable for breeding are limited. Although extrapair paternity rates were only 14\% of offspring and 25\% of nests, they varied greatly among groups, ranging from 4\% to 32\% of offspring and from 7\% to 60\% of nests. These among-group differences in extrapair paternity were not related to social/demographic factors but instead to territory quality; extrapair paternity was higher on lower quality territories (lower vegetation cover and grasshopper abundance) than on higher quality territories (higher vegetation cover and grasshopper abundance). These results suggest that even in a heterogeneous landscape where suitable breeding territories are limited, subtle differences in habitat quality can have profound effects on reproductive decisions and patterns of extrapair paternity. Understanding the interaction between spatial (habitat heterogeneity) and temporal (temporal variability) environmental variation will be important for determining how environmental and social factors drive avian reproductive and mating decisions.},

The integration of these theoretical models encompasses innovative conceptualizations that reconsider the impact of women on human evolution. Several approaches were utilized to weave the strong role of women into an evolutionary psychology framework. The book's high quality of diverse content is tied primarily to the strong theory and science undergirding evolutionary psychology.

  abstract = {The study of non-human animals, in particular primates, can provide essential insights into language evolution. A critical element of language is vocal production learning, i.e. learning how to produce calls. In contrast to other lineages such as songbirds, vocal production learning of completely new signals is strikingly rare in non-human primates. An increasing body of research, however, suggests that various species of non-human primates engage in vocal accommodation and adjust the structure of their calls in response to environmental noise or conspecific vocalizations. To date it is unclear what role vocal accommodation may have played in language evolution, in particular because it summarizes a variety of heterogeneous phenomena which are potentially achieved by different mechanisms. In contrast to non-human primates, accommodation research in humans has a long tradition in psychology and linguistics. Based on theoretical models from these research traditions, we provide a new framework which allows comparing instances of accommodation across species, and studying them according to their underlying mechanism and ultimate biological function. We found that at the mechanistic level, many cases of accommodation can be explained with an automatic perception\textendash production link, but some instances arguably require higher levels of vocal control. Functionally, both human and non-human primates use social accommodation to signal social closeness or social distance to a partner or social group. Together, this indicates that not only some vocal control, but also the communicative function of vocal accommodation to signal social closeness and distance must have evolved prior to the emergence of language, rather than being the result of it. Vocal accommodation as found in other primates has thus endowed our ancestors with pre-adaptations that may have paved the way for language evolution.},

We report the first meta-analysis of typical sex differences on global brain volume, a descriptive account of the breakdown of studies of each compartmental volume by six age categories, and whole-brain voxel-wise meta-analyses on brain volume and density. Gaussian-process regression coordinate-based meta-analysis was used to examine sex differences in voxel-based regional volume and density. On average, males have larger total brain volumes than females. Examination of the breakdown of studies providing total volumes by age categories indicated a bias towards the 18\textendash 59 year-old category. Regional sex differences in volume and tissue density include the amygdala, hippocampus and insula, areas known to be implicated in sex-biased neuropsychiatric conditions. Together, these results suggest candidate regions for investigating the asymmetric effect that sex has on the developing brain, and for understanding sex-biased neurological and psychiatric conditions.},

  abstract = {This study examined the impact of neighborhood racial discrimination on the development of major depressive disorder (MDD) in a sample of African American women. Participants were 499 women from Georgia and Iowa with no history of MDD who were followed for 9 to 11 years. Several neighborhood characteristics (community social disorder, community cohesion, and community racism) and individual characteristics (negative life events, financial strain, personal outlook, religious involvement, relationship quality, negative affectivity, and individual experiences of racism) were employed as predictors of whether or not the women met criteria for MDD during this period of time. In a multilevel logistic regression analysis, neighborhood-level discrimination as well as individual-level variables including the number of negative life events, financial strain, and negative affectivity were found to be significant predictors of developing MDD. Analyses of cross-level interactions indicated that the effects of neighborhood-level discrimination were moderated by the quality of individuals' relationships, such that better relationships with others served to lessen the effect of neighborhood discrimination on depression. Implications of these findings for understand-ing the negative effects of racial discrimination are discussed. General Scientific Summary This study suggests that pervasive racial discrimination in the neighborhood people live in renders them more vulnerable to depression. Over a period of 9 to 11 years, African American women who lived in a neighborhood in which many people experienced racial discrimination were more likely to develop the onset of a first episode of major depression than those who lived in neighborhoods in which lower levels of racial discrimination were reported by residents.},

  abstract = {Morton found that the average emphasized frequency in the songs of tropical bird species in low-forest habitats was lower than that of species in grassland or edge habitats. He suggested that this was due to a frequency window around 1585-2500 Hz in low-forest habitats, and that there was selection to produce songs with frequencies in this window in order to increase the transmission distance of the songs. In the present study, we analyze the constraints of body size and evolutionary history on the ability of avian species to respond to this selection. Also, we examine the spectral distribution of ambient noise as an additional selective factor. There is a correlation between body size and the emphasized frequency of the song for the species analyzed by Morton. Larger birds produce songs with lower emphasized frequencies. Morton's demonstration that birds in the low forest produce songs with lower frequencies is confounded by the fact that larger birds also live in this habitat. Phylogeny is also a potentially confounding factor, since the allometry of size and frequency differs among taxonomic units. Our analyses, however, control for body size and, to some extent, phylogeny, and suggest that there has been an evolutionary response to selection for low-frequency songs by birds in low-forest habitats. Our analysis of ambient noise in low-forest and grassland habitats suggests that this selection might result in part from a relatively quiet region of the ambient noise spectrum in low-forest habitat because of the comparative lack of wind-generated noise and of the abundance of insect-generated sound.}

The frequency of occurrence of the stimuli in the study area was censused. All nestlings showed strong aversive reactions to the alarm-call of the species. It is concluded that a selective responsiveness to this call develops independently of previous exposure to it. A functional interpretation of this reaction is derived from its presumed adaptive value. Three hypothetical interpretations are suggested to explain its emergence in the individual nestling: The call elicits aversive reactions because of (1) its novelty, (2) its intensity in terms of relative concentration of energy over its frequency range, and (3) its contrasting acoustic structure compared to the nestlings' begging call, which has become strongly associated with approach behavior.

However, the majority of comparative analyses of human cultural diversity focus on between-culture variation without consideration for within-culture variation. In contrast, biological approaches to genetic diversity, such as the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) framework, partition genetic diversity into both within- and between-population components. We attempt here for the first time to quantify both components of cultural diversity by applying the AMOVA model to music. By employing this approach with 421 traditional songs from 16 Austronesian-speaking populations, we show that the vast majority of musical variability is due to differences within populations rather than differences between. This demonstrates a striking parallel to the structure of genetic diversity in humans. A neighbour-net analysis of pairwise population musical divergence shows a large amount of reticulation, indicating the pervasive occurrence of borrowing and/or convergent evolution of musical features across populations.},

In this study it is demonstrated that a Bayesian approach provides a new way of understanding this difference, by formalizing the perceptual competition between mental representations and assuming possible nonuniform a priori probabilities of the rhythmic categories. Thus we can relate the two kinds of information and predict perception data from production data. In this approach, the contrast between rhythm perception and production data, taken from different studies in the literature, was shown almost to disappear, assembling independent prior probabilities from counts of patterns in corpora of musical scores, or from a theoretical measure of rhythmic complexity. The success of this Bayesian formalization may be interpreted as an optimal adaptation of our perceptual system to the environment in which the produced rhythms occur.},

Conversely, the sequential structure of nonhuman communication is thought to follow non-hierarchical Markovian dynamics operating over only short distances. Here, we show that human speech and birdsong share a similar sequential structure indicative of both hierarchical and Markovian organization. We analyze the sequential dynamics of song from multiple songbird species and speech from multiple languages by modeling the information content of signals as a function of the sequential distance between vocal elements. Across short sequence-distances, an exponential decay dominates the information in speech and birdsong, consistent with underlying Markovian processes. At longer sequence-distances, the decay in information follows a power law, consistent with underlying hierarchical processes. Thus, the sequential organization of acoustic elements in two learned vocal communication signals (speech and birdsong) shows functionally equivalent dynamics, governed by similar processes.},

Even with a great deal of experience, human characterizations of animal communication can be affected by human perceptual biases. We present a set of computational methods for projecting animal vocalizations into low dimensional latent representational spaces that are directly learned from the spectrograms of vocal signals. We apply these methods to diverse datasets from over 20 species, including humans, bats, songbirds, mice, cetaceans, and nonhuman primates. Latent projections uncover complex features of data in visually intuitive and quantifiable ways, enabling high-powered comparative analyses of vocal acoustics. We introduce methods for analyzing vocalizations as both discrete sequences and as continuous latent variables. Each method can be used to disentangle complex spectro-temporal structure and observe long-timescale organization in communication.},

However, transmission chain experiments in human and non-human primates suggest that cumulative cultural evolution (CCE) might not necessarily depend on high-fidelity copying after all. In this study, we test whether defining properties of CCE can emerge in a non-copying task. We performed transmission chain experiments in Guinea baboons and human children where individuals observed and produced visual patterns composed of four squares on touchscreen devices. In order to be rewarded, participants had to avoid touching squares that were touched by a previous participant. In other words, they were rewarded for innovation rather than copying. Results nevertheless exhibited fundamental properties of CCE: an increase over generations in task performance and the emergence of systematic structure. However, these properties arose from different mechanisms across species: children, unlike baboons, converged in behaviour over generations by copying specific patterns in a different location, thus introducing alternative copying mechanisms into the non-copying task. In children, prior biases towards specific shapes led to convergence in behaviour across chains, while baboon chains showed signs of lineage specificity. We conclude that CCE can result from mechanisms with varying degrees of fidelity in transmission and thus that high-fidelity copying is not necessarily the key to CCE.}

We evaluated similarity in a contact call of the Military Macaw (\emph{Ara militaris}) among three populations along the coast of Jalisco, Mexico. We compared contact calls among sites using two approaches i) analysis of specific acoustic parameter measures using GLMM on Principal Components; and ii) evaluation of spectrogram similarity using cross-correlation with a Mantel test to evaluate site and distance effects. Acoustic parameter analysis found that incorporating the site where recordings were obtained significantly explained variation in call features, for both the complete and reduced, balanced dataset. The spectrogram cross-correlations similarity analysis indicated an association with site in spectral similarity of calls, and that call similarity decreased with distance. Our results demonstrated the accumulation of small, fine-scale changes in Military Macaw calls with distance, suggesting that large-bodied non-oscines such as macaws may be able to maintain connectivity among sites by dispersal, facilitating call diffusion, while limited movements among some populations may account for the differentiation among sites in call features.}

Parent questionnaires were completed to assess behavioral and psychosocial domains including executive function, ADHD and anxiety. Nonverbal intelligence quotients were 56, 80, and 91 for Patients 1, 2, and 3, respectively. There were significantly impaired visual motor capacities in graphomotor and perceptual domains below the 5th centile in Patients 1 and 2, and mildly impaired visual perception skills in Patient 3. All three patients had Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS) but of varying severity and similar executive dysfunction, externalizing problems and social difficulties. Familial learning disabilities (FLD) in Patient 1 and the co-occurrence of ADHD in Patient's 1 and 2 may contribute to their more impaired cognitive performances relative to Patient 3 who is the second reported case of 48, XXXX to have normal intellect. These distinct and overlapping characteristics expand the phenotypic profile of 48, XXXX and may be used in the counseling of families and treatment of children with 48, XXXX.},

  abstract = {Humans and other primates sample the visual environment using saccadic eye movements that shift a high-resolution fovea toward regions of interest to create a clear perception of a scene across fixations. Many mammals, however, like mice, lack a fovea, which raises the question of why they make saccades. Here we describe and test the hypothesis that saccades are matched to natural scene statistics and to the receptive field sizes and adaptive properties of neural populations. Specifically, we determined the minimum amplitude of saccades in natural scenes necessary to provide uncorrelated inputs to model neural populations. This analysis predicts the distributions of observed saccade sizes during passive viewing for nonhuman primates, cats, and mice. Furthermore, disrupting the development of receptive field properties by monocular deprivation changed saccade sizes consistent with this hypothesis. Therefore, natural-scene statistics and the neural representation of natural images appear to be critical factors guiding saccadic eye movements.},

  abstract = {Communication plays an integral role in human social dynamics and is impaired in several neurodevelopmental disorders. Mice are used to study the neurobiology of social behavior; however, the extent to which mouse vocalizations influence social dynamics has remained elusive because it is difficult to identify the vocalizing animal among mice involved in a group interaction. By tracking the ultrasonic vocal behavior of individual mice and using an algorithm developed to group phonically similar signals, we showed that distinct patterns of vocalization emerge as male mice perform specific social actions. Mice dominating other mice were more likely to emit different vocal signals than mice avoiding social interactions. Furthermore, we showed that the patterns of vocal expression influence the behavior of the socially engaged partner but do not influence the behavior of other animals in the cage. These findings clarify the function of mouse communication by revealing a communicative ultrasonic signaling repertoire.}

  abstract = {Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is considered as a health problem that affects millions of women of reproductive age and, in some cases, may be severe enough to be considered a premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Both PMS and PMDD are composed of affective, behavioral, and physical symptoms. Risk factors identified that predispose to PMS/PMDD are age between 25 and 35 years, a psychiatric history, a family history of PMDD, unhealthy living habits, and stressful life events. In addition, a comorbidity of PMDD with various psychiatric disorders such as major depression and anxiety disorders has been established. Although the etiology is unknown, it is considered that PMDD is of a multifactorial nature and is likely to develop because of the interactions among genes, biological variables (the neurotransmitters and gonadal hormones), and environmental influences. The first-line treatment for PMDD is pharmacological with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. From a medical point of view there is some evidence of the efficacy of nonpharmacological treatments such as relaxation, aerobic, and cognitive behavioral therapy, which are used mostly in mild cases. The major criticisms made to the conceptualization of PMDD as a clinical syndrome focus on pathologizing women's biology and its consequent medicalization, which perpetuated misconceptions related to menses. Medicine would be opened up to other fields such as anthropology, sociology, and gender studies with qualitative studies to look for context and meaning to women's suffering. It has been suggested that it might be more appropriate to introduce the concept of premenstrual or perimenstrual experience instead of PMDD.

  abstract = {Large carnivores, such as gray wolves, Canis lupus, are difficult to protect in mixed-use landscapes because some people perceive them as dangerous and because they sometimes threaten human property and safety. Governments may respond by killing carnivores in an effort to prevent repeated conflicts or threats, although the functional effectiveness of lethal methods has long been questioned. We evaluated two methods of government intervention following independent events of verified wolf predation on domestic animals (depredation) in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA between 1998\textendash 2014, at three spatial scales. We evaluated two intervention methods using log-rank tests and conditional Cox recurrent event, gap time models based on retrospective analyses of the following quasi-experimental treatments: (1) selective killing of wolves by trapping near sites of verified depredation, and (2) advice to owners and haphazard use of non-lethal methods without wolf-killing. The government did not randomly assign treatments and used a pseudo-control (no removal of wolves was not a true control), but the federal permission to intervene lethally was granted and rescinded independent of events on the ground. Hazard ratios suggest lethal intervention was associated with an insignificant 27\% lower risk of recurrence of events at trapping sites, but offset by an insignificant 22\% increase in risk of recurrence at sites up to 5.42 km distant in the same year, compared to the non-lethal treatment. Our results do not support the hypothesis that Michigan's use of lethal intervention after wolf depredations was effective for reducing the future risk of recurrence in the vicinities of trapping sites. Examining only the sites of intervention is incomplete because neighbors near trapping sites may suffer the recurrence of depredations. We propose two new hypotheses for perceived effectiveness of lethal methods: (a) killing predators may be perceived as effective because of the benefits to a small minority of farmers, and (b) if neighbors experience side-effects of lethal intervention such as displaced depredations, they may perceive the problem growing and then demand more lethal intervention rather than detecting problems spreading from the first trapping site. Ethical wildlife management guided by the ``best scientific and commercial data available'' would suggest suspending the standard method of trapping wolves in favor of non-lethal methods (livestock guarding dogs or fladry) that have been proven effective in preventing livestock losses in Michigan and elsewhere.},

METHOD: Epidemiological data in the international literature addressing the issue of material poverty as a risk factor for the development of mental illness and as a prognostic factor for the outcome of mental illness were reviewed. RESULTS: The international literature reviewed supports the notion that material poverty is a risk factor for a negative outcome among mentally ill people. In addition, preliminary epidemiological data suggest that service-related variables may be determinants of outcome of mental illnesses. In our view, cooperation with developing countries is a great opportunity to evaluate mental health services in a natural setting. CONCLUSIONS: A new generation of programs for international cooperation in mental health is needed, in which knowledge and technology transfer is based on a service-research attitude. Attention should be focused on variables related to the poverty of services that might be linked to the course and outcome of mental illnesses.},

  abstract = {Altered sensory experience in early life often leads to remarkable adaptations so that humans and animals can make the best use of the available information in a particular environment. By restricting visual input to a limited range of orientations in young animals, this investigation shows that stimulus selectivity, e.g., the sharpness of tuning of single neurons in the primary visual cortex, is modified to match a particular environment. Specifically, neurons tuned to an experienced orientation in orientation-restricted animals show sharper orientation tuning than neurons in normal animals, whereas the opposite was true for neurons tuned to non-experienced orientations. This sharpened tuning appears to be due to elongated receptive fields. Our results demonstrate that restricted sensory experiences can sculpt the supranormal functions of single neurons tailored for a particular environment. The above findings, in addition to the minimal population response to orientations close to the experienced one, agree with the predictions of a sparse coding hypothesis in which information is represented efficiently by a small number of activated neurons. This suggests that early brain areas adopt an efficient strategy for coding information even when animals are raised in a severely limited visual environment where sensory inputs have an unnatural statistical structure.},

Although knowledge accumulation is recognized as a major advantage of group living within the framework of Cumulative Cultural Evolution (CCE), the interplay between CCE and collective intelligence has remained unexplored. Here, we use homing pigeons to investigate whether the repeated removal and replacement of individuals in experimental groups (a key method in testing for CCE) alters the groups' solution efficiency over successive generations. Homing performance improves continuously over generations, and later-generation groups eventually outperform both solo individuals and fixed-membership groups. Homing routes are more similar in consecutive generations within the same chains than between chains, indicating cross-generational knowledge transfer. Our findings thus show that collective intelligence in animal groups can accumulate progressive modifications over time. Furthermore, our results satisfy the main criteria for CCE and suggest potential mechanisms for CCE that do not rely on complex cognition.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a common health problem in women in reproductive age. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of PMS using meta-analysis method. METHODS This meta-analysis systematically reviewed the prevalence of PMS. A search was conducted using keywords Premenstrual Syndrome, PMS, prevalence PMS and symptom of PMS in reliable English articles. The initial search 53 articles were available. After review of full-text articles, 17 articles were selected for analysis. Data were combined using meta-analysis (random effects model). Data were analyzed using STATA software, Version 11.1 RESULTS: Overall, 17 studies met our inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of PMS was 47.8\% (95\% CI: 32.6-62.9). The lowest and highest prevalence were reported in France 12\% (95\% CI: 11-13) and Iran 98\% (95\% CI: 97-100) respectively. However, meta-regression scatter plot showed an increasing trend in the prevalence of PMS during 1996-2011 but correlation between prevalence of PMS and year of study was not significance (p= 0.797). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS Considering that different tools have been used in studies and many studies have been designed based on a limited sample, therefore, future research needs to consider the prevalence of PMS in different countries of world.},

  abstract = {There has recently been renewed interest in using quantitative data to explore questions about musical universals. One explanation for certain musical universals is that they reflect ways of singing that are most energetically efficient, as opposed to biological specializations for human music. Previous research found support for this ``motor constraint hypothesis'' by comparing pitch contour shapes in samples of human and avian songs, but the sample of human songs was limited to notated scores of European and Chinese folk songs from the Essen database. Here we test this hypothesis using a more diverse global sample of human music recordings from the Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. By directly comparing pitch contour shapes in a diverse sample of human songs and bird songs, we found that both human and bird songs tend to employ similar descending/ arched melodic contours despite substantial differences in absolute pitch and duration. This preference was consistent for both Western and non-Western songs. Surprisingly, we also found that the global samples of human and bird song contours were significantly more correlated with one another than either was with the Essen contours. Our findings of broad cross-cultural and cross-species parallels support the motor constraint hypothesis for melodic contour. More generally, our findings demonstrate the importance of greater collaboration between ethnomusicology and music psychology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors reported the feasibility and safety of thoracoscopic approach for resection of the esophagus in two patients with diffuse corrosive esophageal stricture., BACKGROUND: The unrelenting corrosive strictures of esophagus merit esophageal substitution. Because of the risk of complications in the retained esophagus, such as malignancy, mucocele, gastroesophageal reflux, and bleeding, esophageal resection is deemed necessary. Transthoracic approach for esophageal resection is considered safe but requiring thoracotomy. Transhiatal resection of a scared esophagus could be associated with serious complications. Less was known regarding the safety and feasibility of thoracoscopic resection of the esophagus in corrosive stricture of the esophagus., MATERIAL AND METHOD: Thoracoscopic approach was used for mobilization of the scarred esophagus in two female patients. Laparotomy with colonic mobilization was performed in the second phase of the operation. Pharyngocolonic and esophagocolonic anastomosis were done via left neck incision in each patient. Intra-operative and post-operative complications were observed. Swallowing ability was assessed in the early postoperative period., RESULTS: Thoracoscopic esophageal mobilization was successfully performed without complications. Any adhesions around the esophagus could be clearly seen and divided using harmonic scalpel under direct vision. Operative duration of the thoracoscopic part was 104 and 120 minutes and total blood loss was 320 and 350 ml respectively. Postoperative period was uneventful. The patient could have regular diet on day 8 and 9 after surgery., CONCLUSION: Thoracoscopic approach for esophageal resection could be safely performed for the extirpation of diffuse esophageal stricture. Postoperative complication is being assessed in the authors' prospective trial.},

  abstract = {Although it has been shown that cortical thickness (Cth) differs between sexes, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Seeing as XXY males have 1 extra X chromosome, we investigated the possible effects of X- and sex-chromosome dosage on Cth by comparing data from 31 XXY males with 39 XY and 47 XX controls. Plasma testosterone and estrogen were also measured in an effort to differentiate between possible sex-hormone and sex-chromosome gene effects. Cth was calculated with FreeSurfer software. Parietal and occipital Cth was greater in XX females than XY males. In these regions Cth was inversely correlated with z-normalized testosterone. In the motor strip, the cortex was thinner in XY males compared with both XX females and XXY males, indicating the possibility of an X-chromosome gene-dosage effect. XXY males had thinner right superior temporal and left middle temporal cortex, and a thicker right orbitofrontal cortex and lingual cortex than both control groups. Based on these data and previous reports from women with XO monosomy, it is hypothesized that programming of the motor cortex is influenced by processes linked to X-escapee genes, which do not have Y-chromosome homologs, and that programming of the superior temporal cortex is mediated by X-chromosome escapee genes with Y-homologs.},

For the author, a review can establish them as an au- thority in a particular area, and a good review paper can be widely read and highly cited. Unlike most standard research papers, writing a review requires no resources beyond library access, a computer and a great idea. But that does not make writing a good review paper easy; it requires substantial investment of time and thought, and a large dose of creativity. A good review paper not only summarises the current state of knowledge in a particular area, it also synthesises the literature to provide new insights and advance that field of re- search (Denney \& Tewksbury, 2013; Pautasso, 2013; Torraco, 2005; Van Wee \& Banister, 2016; Webster \& Watson, 2002).

  abstract = {Publication bias arises whenever the probability that a study is published depends on the statistical significance of its results. This bias, often called the file-drawer effect since the unpublished results are imagined to be tucked away in researchers' file cabinets, is potentially a severe impediment to combining the statistical results of studies collected from the literature. With almost any reasonable quantitative model for publication bias, only a small number of studies lost in the file-drawer will produce a significant bias. This result contradicts the well known Fail Safe File Drawer (FSFD) method for setting limits on the potential harm of publication bias, widely used in social, medical and psychic research. This method incorrectly treats the file drawer as unbiased, and almost always misestimates the seriousness of publication bias. A large body of not only psychic research, but medical and social science studies, has mistakenly relied on this method to validate claimed discoveries. Statistical combination can be trusted only if it is known with certainty that all studies that have been carried out are included. Such certainty is virtually impossible to achieve in literature surveys.},

  abstract = {FoxP2 mutations in humans are associated with a disorder that affects both the comprehension of language and its production, speech. This discovery provided the first opportunity to analyze the genetics of language with molecular and neurobiological tools. The amino acid sequence and the neural expression pattern of FoxP2 are extremely conserved, from reptile to man. This suggests an important role for FoxP2 in vertebrate brains, regardless of whether they support imitative vocal learning or not. Its expression pattern pinpoints neural circuits that might have been crucial for the evolution of speech and language, including the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Recent studies in songbirds show that during times of song plasticity FoxP2 is upregulated in a striatal region essential for song learning. This suggests that FoxP2 plays important roles both in the development of neural circuits and in the postnatal behaviors they mediate. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper investigates the metrology of a two-dimensional PSD working alternately in direct or indirect (reflective) mode.

One marker of better phenotypic condition is thought to be symmetrical bilateral body and facial features. However, it is not clear whether women use symmetry as the primary cue in assessing the phenotypic quality of potential mates or whether symmetry is correlated with other facial markers affecting physical attractiveness. Using photographs of men's faces, for which facial symmetry had been measured, we found a relationship between women's attractiveness ratings of these faces and symmetry, but the subjects could not rate facial symmetry accurately. Moreover, the relationship between facial attractiveness and symmetry was still observed, even when symmetry cues were removed by presenting only the left or right half of faces. These results suggest that attractive features other than symmetry can be used to assess phenotypic condition. We identified one such cue, facial masculinity (cheek-bone prominence and a relatively longer lower face), which was related to both symmetry and full- and half-face attractiveness.},

In a one-cycle prospective study, various premenstrual symptoms of 91 women were assessed. Tension and irritability were the most severe symptoms. Headache, irritability, self-deprecating thoughts and depressed mood were the symptoms that were subjectively rated as most burdensome. Significant correlations were found between the mean premenstrual severity and functional impairment. The severity of premenstrual affective symptoms was related to social impairment. The severity of psychological symptoms was correlated with occupational impairment. These findings confirm the prominent role of premenstrual affective symptoms and support classification guidelines focusing on both affective and physical experience changes.},

  abstract = {The question how music influences the perception of lyrics is rather complicated. There are indications that music enhances the perception, comprehension and memorization of sung language, but also that it obstructs language perception and comprehension by withdrawing attention from the words, or undermining their meaning. The linguistic concept of foregrounding, might be helpful to understand the paradoxical way in which music seems to affect lyric perception. Foregrounding (the use of stylistic features such as metaphors and parallelisms, etcetera) is supposed to obstruct normal understanding, but, by doing so, to draw attention to the language too. Foregrounding, for example, both slows down reading and increases strikingness and affects ratings. The Musical Foregrounding Hypothesis (MFH) states that matching music to words has a similar effect to language perception as linguistic foregrounding. However, music is far more complex than any stylistic feature. Music consists of components such as rhythm, pitch, harmony, song structure, etcetera, all of which might affect lyric perception independently. This leads to several sub-hypotheses. An MFH-based model for lyric perception explains the relations between the MFH and these sub-hypotheses. Support for some of these sub-hypotheses is found in the existing literature, others should be tested. The MFH offers an interdisciplinary approach to song and to the relationship between language and music, that might be},

Anthropologists defend- ing accounts of primate or human biological development and evolution that conflict with mainstream ``neo-Darwinian'' thinking have sometimes been called ``creationists'' or have been accused of being ``antiscience.'' As a result, many cultural anthropologists struggle with an ``anti-antievolutionism'' dilemma: they are more comfortable opposing the critics of evolutionary biology, broadly conceived, than they are defending mainstream evolutionary views with which they disagree. Evolutionary theory, however, comes in many forms. Relational evolutionary approaches such as Developmental Systems Theory, niche construction, and autopoiesis\textendash natural drift augment mainstream evolutionary thinking in ways that should prove attractive to many anthropologists who wish to affirm evolution but are dissatisfied with current ``neo-Darwinian'' hegemony.

Plasticity and robustness have historically been studied by evolutionary biologists through quantitative genetic and reaction norm approaches, while more recent efforts emerging from evolutionary developmental biology have begun to characterize the molecular and developmental genetic underpinnings of both plastic and robust trait formation. In this review, we explore how our growing mechanistic understanding of plasticity and robustness is beginning to force a revision of our perception of both phenomena, away from our conventional view of plasticity and robustness as opposites along a continuum and toward a framework that emphasizes their reciprocal, constructive, and integrative nature. We do so in three sections. Following an introduction, the first section looks inward and reviews the genetic, epigenetic, and developmental mechanisms that enable organisms to sense and respond to environmental conditions, maintaining and adjusting trait formation in the process. In the second section, we change perspective and look outward, exploring the ways in which organisms reciprocally shape their environments in ways that influence trait formation, and do so through the lens of behavioral plasticity, niche construction, and host-microbiota interactions. In the final section, we revisit established plasticity and robustness concepts in light of these findings, and highlight research opportunities to further advance our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of these ubiquitous, and interrelated, phenomena.},

  abstract = {For camouflaged prey, enhanced conspicuousness due to bilaterally symmetrical coloration increases predation risk. The ubiquity of symmetrical body patterns in nature is therefore paradoxical, perhaps explicable through tight developmental constraints. Placing patterns that would be salient when symmetrical (e.g. high contrast markings) away from the axis of symmetry is one possible strategy to reduce the predation cost of symmetrical coloration. Artificial camouflaged prey with symmetrical patterns placed at different distances from the axis were used in both visual search tasks with humans and survival experiments with wild avian predators. Targets were less conspicuous when symmetrical patterning was placed outside a 'critical zone' near the midline. To assess whether real animals have evolved as predicted from these experiments, the saliency of features at different distances from the midline was measured in the cryptically coloured forewings of 36 lepidopteran species. Salience, both in absolute terms and relative to wing area, was greatest away from the axis of symmetry. Our work, therefore, demonstrates that prey morphologies may have evolved to exploit a loophole in the ability of mammalian and avian visual systems to spot symmetrical patterns.}

This enables researchers to study both the cognitive capacities necessary for language and the ways in which languages themselves emerge.

Here, we subject NCT to critical evaluation, in the form of a collaboration between one prominent advocate of NCT, and a team of skeptics. We discuss whether niche construction is an evolutionary process, whether NCT obscures or clarifies how natural selection leads to organismal adaptation, and whether niche construction and natural selection are of equivalent explanatory importance. We also consider whether the literature that promotes NCT overstates the significance of niche construction, whether it is internally coherent, and whether it accurately portrays standard evolutionary theory. Our disagreements reflect a wider dispute within evolutionary theory over whether the neo-Darwinian synthesis is in need of reformulation, as well as different usages of some key terms (e.g., evolutionary process).},

There is much agreement between these two schools of thought, including in par5cular a commitment to popula5on thinking. Both schools also agree that the propaga5on of culture is not simply a ma,er of replica5on, but rather one of reconstruc5on. However, the two schools of thought differ on the rela5ve importance of this point. The cultural a,rac5on school believes it to be fundamental to genuinely causal explana5ons of culture. In contrast, most mainstream cultural evolu5on thinking abstracts away from it. In this paper I present a simple transmission chain experiment that directly contrasts the effects that replica5on and reconstruc5on have on cultural items. Results demonstrate, in a simple and graphic way, that (i) normal cultural propaga5on is not replica5ve, but reconstruc5ve, and (ii) that these two different modes of propaga5on afford two qualita5vely different explana5ons of stability. If propaga5on is replica5ve (as it is in biology), then stability arises from the fidelity of that replica5on, and hence an explana5on of stability comes from an explana5on of how and why this high-\--fidelity is achieved. If, on the other hand, propaga5on is reconstruc5ve (as it is in culture), then stability arises from the fact that a subclass of cultural types are easily re-\--producible, while others are not, and hence an explana5on of stability comes from a descrip5on of what types are easily re-\--producible, and an explana5on of why they are.

  abstract = {One explanation for why female songbirds attend to male song is that the quality of a male's song is associated with the quality of his developmental history. We tested this hypothesis by playing back to female swamp sparrows (Melospiza georgiana) songs recorded from males of either inferior or superior developmental histories, as assessed by their rates of mass gain during the first 18~days post-hatching. Females showed significantly higher levels of courtship display in response to songs of males with superior growth than to songs of males with inferior growth. Out of nine song traits measured, only song duration correlated with variation in female response; duration was also the only trait that differed significantly in univariate comparisons between the superior growth songs and the inferior growth songs. In a multivariate analysis, however, inferior growth songs were best discriminated from superior growth songs by combining three song traits: trill rate, stereotypy, and the number of notes per syllable. We suggest that early developmental stress degrades song in many small ways, and that it is the cumulative effect of the resulting deficits that explains lower female response.},

  abstract = {Songbirds as a whole are considered to be vocal production learners, meaning that they modify the structure of their vocalizations as a result of experience with the vocalizations of others. The more than 4000 species of songbirds, however, vary greatly in crucial features of song development. Variable features include: (i) the normality of the songs of early-deafened birds, reflecting the importance of innate motor programmes in song development; (ii) the normality of the songs of isolation-reared birds, reflecting the combined importance of innate auditory templates and motor programmes; (iii) the degree of selectivity in choice of external models; (iv) the accuracy of copying from external models; and (v) whether or not learning from external models continues into adulthood. We suggest that because of this variability, some songbird species, specifically those that are able to develop songs in the normal range without exposure to external models, can be classified as limited vocal learners. Those species that require exposure to external models to develop songs in the normal range can be considered complex vocal learners.

Here, we test for long-distance dependencies in the sequences of songs produced by song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). Song sparrows sing with eventual variety, repeating each song type in a consecutive series termed a `bout'. We show that in switching between song types, song sparrows follow a `cycling rule', cycling through their repertoires in close to the minimum possible number of bouts. Song sparrows do not cycle in a set order but rather vary the order of song types from cycle to cycle. Cycling in a variable order strongly implies long-distance dependencies, in which choice of the next type depends on the song types sung over the past cycle, in the range of 9\textendash 10 bouts. Song sparrows also follow a `bout length rule', whereby the number of repetitions of a song type in a bout is positively associated with the length of the interval until that type recurs. This rule requires even longer distance dependencies that cross one another; such dependencies are characteristic of more complex levels of syntax than previously attributed to non-human animals.},

  abstract = {Geographical variation has been widely studied in oscine songbirds, with particular attention paid to the interplay between variables associated with learned song and dispersal. While most field-based studies have focused on discrete dialects, analysing data from quickly growing citizen science libraries could uncover geographical patterns in species previously thought to exhibit random variation in song. Specifically, using citizen science birdsong databases, we test whether chipping sparrow, Spizella passerina, song is geographically structured on a continental scale. The chipping sparrow is a particularly well-suited species for this study, since individuals have a simple song of one repeated syllable, have only the beginning of their first breeding season to adjust their song before crystallization and have been shown to match their song to a nearby neighbour while establishing their first territory. If most chipping sparrows adopt a neighbour-matching strategy, we might expect local syllable similarity; in contrast, field studies have shown that local syllable diversity has been maintained over time. We analyse 820 individual recordings of the simple, yet diverse, song of chipping sparrows to assess whether long-range geographical patterns have formed despite this local song variation. We found significant correlations between song features and geographical distance, associated with longitude but not latitude: chipping sparrows in the eastern United States and Canada sing at a slower rate (fewer, longer syllables) than the western population. However, comparing individual syllable types between regions, we found diverse song types persist across this species' range. To better contextualize our findings, we re-evaluate available genetic sequences of chipping sparrows to test for genetic differentiation between the eastern and western populations in which we found song differences. Our results suggest that there are two culturally distinct subpopulations of migratory chipping sparrows that are genetically indistinguishable using mitochondrial DNA, motivating future studies on migration patterns and additional sequencing of nuclear DNA.},

This increase in digital recordings necessitates an increase in high-throughput methods of analysis for researchers. Specifically, there is a need in the community for open-source methods that are tailored to recordings of varying qualities and from multiple species collected in nature. We developed Chipper, a Python-based software to semi-automate both the segmentation of acoustic signals and the subsequent analysis of their frequencies and durations. For avian recordings, we provide widgets to best determine appropriate thresholds for noise and syllable similarity, which aid in calculating note measurements and determining song syntax. In addition, we generated a set of synthetic songs with various levels of background noise to test Chipper's accuracy, repeatability and reproducibility. Chipper provides an effective way to quickly generate quantitative, reproducible measures of birdsong. The cross-platform graphical user interface allows the user to adjust parameters and visualize the resulting spectrogram and signal segmentation, providing a simplified method for analysing field recordings. Chipper streamlines the processing of audio recordings with multiple user-friendly tools and is optimized for multiple species and varying recording qualities. Ultimately, Chipper supports the use of citizen-science data and increases the feasibility of large-scale multi-species birdsong studies.},

  abstract = {Given that evolutionary divergence in mating signals leads to reproductive isolation in numerous animal taxa, understanding what drives signal divergence is fundamental to our understanding of speciation. Mating signals are thought to diverge via several processes, including (1) as a by-product of morphological adaptation, (2) through direct adaptation to the signaling environment, or (3) to facilitate species recognition. According to the first two hypotheses, birdsongs diversify in different foraging niches and habitats as a product of selection for optimal morphology and efficient sound transmission, respectively. According to the third hypothesis, they diversify as a result of selection against maladaptive hybridization. In this study I test all three hypotheses by examining the influence of morphology, acoustic environment, and the presence of closely related congeners on song structure in 163 species of antbird (Thamnophilidae). Unlike oscine passerines, these Neotropical suboscines make ideal subjects because they develop their songs without learning. In other words, patterns of vocal divergence are not complicated by cultural evolution. In support of the morphological adaptation hypothesis, body mass correlates with the acoustic frequency of songs, and bill size with temporal patterning. These relationships were robust, even when controlling for phylogenetic inertia using independent contrasts, suggesting that there has been correlated evolution between morphological and acoustic traits. The results also support the acoustic adaptation hypothesis: birds which habitually sing in the understory and canopy produce higher-pitched songs than those that sing in the midstory, suggesting that song structure is related to the sound transmission properties of different habitat strata. Finally, the songs of sympatric pairs of closely related species are more divergent than those of allopatric pairs, as predicted by the species recognition hypothesis. To my knowledge, these data provide the first direct evidence that species recognition and ecological adaptation operate in tandem, and that the interplay between these factors drives the evolution of mating signals in suboscine birds.},

Cultural evolution models show that the emergence of near universal properties of language do not require the preexistence of strong specific constraints. Instead, the development of general abilities, unrelated to informational specificity, like the copying of complex signals and sharing of communicative intentions is required for cultural evolution to yield specific properties, such as language structure. We argue that eco-evo-devo provides the appropriate conceptual background to ground an account for the many interconnected genetic, environmental and developmental factors that facilitated the emergence of an organic system able to develop language through the iterated transmission of information. We use the concept of niche construction to connect evolutionary developmental accounts for sensory guided motor capacities and cultural evolution guided by iterated learning models. This integrated theoretical model aims to build bridges between biological and cultural approaches.}

However, paradoxes in the training and effectiveness of deep learning networks are being investigated and insights are being found in the geometry of high-dimensional spaces. A mathematical theory of deep learning would illuminate how they function, allow us to assess the strengths and weaknesses of different network architectures, and lead to major improvements. Deep learning has provided natural ways for humans to communicate with digital devices and is foundational for building artificial general intelligence. Deep learning was inspired by the architecture of the cerebral cortex and insights into autonomy and general intelligence may be found in other brain regions that are essential for planning and survival, but major breakthroughs will be needed to achieve these goals.}

Here the recent finding of patterning consistent with the law of brevity in Formosan macaque vocal communication (Semple, Hsu, \& Agoramoorthy, 2010) is revisited. It is shown that the negative correlation between mean duration and frequency of use in the vocalizations of Formosan macaques is not an artefact of the use of a mean duration for each call type instead of the customary `word' length of studies of the law in human language. The key point demonstrated is that the total duration of calls of a particular type increases with the number of calls of that type. The finding of the law of brevity in the vocalizations of these macaques therefore defies a trivial explanation.},

We therefore concluded that the observed distribution of orientation preferences had not been affected by head rotations, and we pooled results from all kittens (Fig. 2b). On average, the experienced orientation occupied 35.3\% of the cortical surface, and the other three orientations each between 21\% and 22\%, corresponding to an overrepre-sentation of the experienced orientation by 64.7\% compared with the orthogonal. In contrast, in the eight control animals with normal contour experience, the difference in representation of orthogonal orientations (0\textdegree{} versus 90\textdegree{} and 45\textdegree{} versus 135\textdegree ) was on average 9.4\%. Thus, the cortical area preferring the experienced orientation in the stripe-reared animals was significantly higher (p {$<$} 0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test) than the area preferring the best orientation in the kittens with normal contour experience. For a conservative estimate of significance, the distributions of cortical area versus orientation for the eight control animals were aligned post hoc at the orientation yielding the largest area, designated 0\textdegree{} (Fig. 2b), a procedure which for normal rearing conditions actually overestimates the amount of anisotropy.

Many of the structural regularities underlying musical discourse are yet to be discovered and, accordingly, their historical evolution remains formally unknown. Here we unveil a number of patterns and metrics characterizing the generic usage of primary musical facets such as pitch, timbre, and loudness in contemporary western popular music. Many of these patterns and metrics have been consistently stable for a period of more than fifty years, thus pointing towards a great degree of conventionalism. Nonetheless, we prove important changes or trends related to the restriction of pitch transitions, the homogenization of the timbral palette, and the growing loudness levels. This suggests that our perception of the new would be rooted on these changing characteristics. Hence, an old tune could perfectly sound novel and fashionable, provided that it consisted of common harmonic progressions, changed the instrumentation, and increased the average loudness.},

Cultural hierarchies of knowl-edge and the hegemony of the natural sciences create a barrier to interdisciplinary understandings. Here, we review three different projects that confront this difficulty, integrating biological and ethnographic methods to study conservation problems. The first project involved wildlife foraging on crops around a newly established national park in Gabon. Biological methods revealed the extent of crop loss, the species responsible, and an effect of field isolation, while ethnography revealed institutional and social vulnerability to foraging wildlife. The second project concerned great ape tourism in the Central African Republic. Biological methods revealed that gorilla tourism poses risks to gorillas, while ethnography revealed why people seek close proximity to gorillas. The third project focused on humans and other primates living alongside one another in Morocco. Incorporating shepherds in the coproduction of ecological knowledge about primates built trust and altered attitudes to the primates. These three case studies},

Monitoring these ecosystem-level changes often requires labor-intensive surveys that are unable to detect rapid or unanticipated environmental changes. Here we have developed a generalizable, data-driven solution to this challenge using ecoacoustic data. We exploited a convolutional neural network to embed soundscapes from a variety of ecosystems into a common acoustic space. In both supervised and unsupervised modes, this allowed us to accurately quantify variation in habitat quality across space and in biodiversity through time. On the scale of seconds, we learned a typical soundscape model that allowed automatic identification of anomalous sounds in playback experiments, providing a potential route for real-time automated detection of irregular environmental behavior including illegal logging and hunting. Our highly generalizable approach, and the common set of features, will enable scientists to unlock previously hidden insights from acoustic data and offers promise as a backbone technology for global collaborative autonomous ecosystem monitoring efforts.},

Accordingly, R. Thornhill, S. W. Gangestad, and R. Comer (1995) found that women mated to more attractive men reported an orgasm during a greater proportion of copulations than did women mated to less attractive men. The current research replicates this finding, with several design variations. We collected self-report data from 388 women residing in the United States or in Germany. Results support the hypothesis that women mated to more attractive men are more likely to report an orgasm at the most recent copulation than are women mated to less attractive men, after statistically controlling for several key variables. Discussion addresses (a) the inability of the present research to specify the causal link between female orgasm and male attractiveness and (b) the proactive nature of female sexuality documented in recent research guided by an evolutionary perspective.},

We evaluate the phenotypic variations at TAS2R38 gene locus in relation to PMS severity and adiposity measures among adult women. This is the first ever report describing association of PTC taste genetic locus with the PMS susceptibility. METHODS: The study was based on a cross-sectional sample of 105 adult rural women from the Kullu district, Himachal Pradesh. Retrospective approach was used to assess PMS. PTC tasting ability was assessed after Harris \& Kalmus (1949). Each subject was measured for height, weight and body fat measures. RESULTS: 19.05\% of the females were PTC non-tasters and 80.95\% were tasters. Prevalence of PMS was 45.71\%. Prevalence of severe type of PMS was very low, varying from 0-6\%. Severity was highest in PMS-A type characterized by anxiety/irritability, tension, clumsiness, mood swings, nervousness, and insomnia. Females who tasted PTC bitter at lower concentrations had lowest PMS prevalence, while those who tasted PTC at higher concentration had highest PMS prevalence. Stature and body weight decreased with increase in PTC taste sensitivity. However, one-way ANOVA revealed that all the F-ratios were insignificant between the three discrete categories of low, medium and high PTC thresholds. CONCLUSION: Our results are compatible with the hypothesis that the bitter receptor gene TAS2R38 could not serve as a significant predictor of anthropometric measurements though some indirect pathways may not be ruled out, but the gene is significantly correlated with PMS susceptibility and severity.},

Participants were 287 adults belonging to three groups (British Asian, western European and Pakistanis). Method: Participants completed two ques-tionnaires: the Orientations to Seeking Professional Help (Fischer and Turner 1970) and the Mental Distress Explanatory Model Questionnaire (Eisenbruch 1990) and a demographic data sheet. Results: Analysis indi-cated that positive attitudes toward seeking professional help for psychological distress were similar for British Asians, Westerners and Pakistanis. There were signi\textregistered -cant dierences between the three groups in the causal attributions of mental distress. Although culture, as a variable, was not a signi\textregistered cant predictor of a positive attitude to seeking professional help, causal beliefs of mental distress were signi\textregistered cant predictors of attitudes to seeking help for the British Asian and the Pakistani groups. Beliefs were not signi\textregistered cant predictors for atti-tudes to seeking help for the Western group. Conclusion: It was concluded that culturally determined causal beliefs of mental distress contribute to attitudes towards seeking professional help for psychological problems for Asians.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Anthropogenic noise pollution and the introduction of novel infrastructure can impose strong selective pressures on avian communication by affecting the efficacy with which acoustic signals are transmitted and received. Many species have now been shown to sing at higher frequencies in noisy urban environments. However, few studies have investigated the effects of signal modification on the response behaviours of receivers, and fewer still have been able to indicate the timescale over which these changes in pitch have occurred. We compare vocal communication between house sparrows (\emph{Passer domesticus}) that reside within the world's largest, single-span glasshouse (completed in the year 2000), and house sparrows directly outside this glasshouse, in open farmland. The glasshouse contrasts both acoustically and physically with the external environment, low frequency background noise being significantly louder inside than outside. We show that minimum song frequency was significantly higher inside the glasshouse than in surrounding farm habitat. Using song playback, we also found that birds within the glasshouse reacted more strongly to playbacks from the glasshouse habitat than they did to playback of song from farm birds outside. The degree of difference in frequency is similar to that shown for other bird species between urban and rural environments, demonstrating that such behavioural differences may arise over a relatively short time period (14 years in this case).{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}This article is protected by copyright.

The aim of this article is to describe the co-morbidity of SD with depression/anxiety and to investigate the possible mechanisms of this relationship in women in low and middle income countries (LMIC). Methods: We reviewed two databases: MEDLINE and PsycINFO from 1994 to 2012 for studies which assessed the association between any SD and depression/ anxiety in women from LMIC. Our focus was on community and primary healthcare based studies. Both quantitative and qualitative studies were included. Results: A total of 21 studies covering eight LMICs were included in our analysis. Our findings suggest a strong association between SD and depression/anxiety (with odds ratios ranging from 2.5\textendash 3.5), though we also observed that the majority of women with SD did not have depression/anxiety. The likely mechanisms for this association are multidimensional, and may include shared aetiologies, that both conditions are in fact variants of the same primary mental disorder, and that one disorder is a risk factor for the other. Anthropological research offers a number of frameworks through which we can view these mechanisms. Conclusion: The current evidence indicates that service providers at the primary care level should be sensitized to consider SD in women as variants of CMD (Common Mental Disorders) and address both groups of disorders concurrently. Further research should explicitly seek to unpack the mechanisms of the relationship between SD and CMD.},

Research sug-gests that concurrent clitoral stimulation during intercourse increases the likelihood of orgasm, yet most surveys of orgasm during intercourse leave unspecified whether vaginal intercourse does or does not include concurrent clitoral stimulation (assisted intercourse or unassisted intercourse, respectively). Using an online sample of 1569 men and 1478 women, we tested whether phrasing of questions about the occurrence of orgasm in inter-course modulates women's reported frequency and men's esti-mates of women's frequency of orgasm in intercourse. Partici-pants provided estimatesof orgasm when asked explicitly about intercourse with stimulation unspecified, assisted intercourse, and unassisted intercourse. Women's reports of orgasm occur-rence were highest in response to assisted intercourse (51\textendash 60\%), second highest in response to intercourse with clitoral stimula-tion unspecified (31\textendash 40\%), and lowest in response to unassisted intercourse (21\textendash 30\%). Men's estimates of women's orgasms were highest in response to assisted intercourse (61\textendash 70\%), and lowest in response to unassisted intercourse (41\textendash 50\%); in both conditions, men's estimates were significantly higher than women's reports. When clitoral stimulation was unspecified, women interpreted''orgasm in intercourse''in three ways: as from intercourse alone, as including concurrent clitoral stimulation though it was unspecified, or as an average of assisted and unassisted intercourse. Taken together, these results demon-strate that the phrasing of questions about women's orgasm produces markedly different orgasm estimates, and suggest that concurrent clitoral stimulation increases the likelihood of women experiencing orgasm in intercourse.},

  abstract = {Demographic processes play a key role in shaping the patterns of social relations among individuals in a population. Social network analysis is a powerful quantitative tool for assessing the social structure formed by associations between individuals. However, demographic processes are rarely accounted for in such analyses. Here, we summarize how the structure of animal social networks is shaped by the joint effects of social behavior and turnover of individuals and suggest how a deeper understanding of these processes can open new, exciting avenues for research. Death or dispersal can have the direct effect of removing an individual and all its social connections, and can also have indirect effects, spurring changes in the distribution of social connections between remaining individuals. Recruitment and integration of juveniles and immigrant into existing social networks are critical to the emergence and persistence of social network structure. Together, these behavioral responses to loss and gain of social partners may impact how societies respond to seasonal or catastrophic turnover events. The fitness consequences of social position (e.g., survival and reproductive rates) may also create feedback between the social network structure and demography. Understanding how social structure changes in response to turnover of individuals requires further integration between long-term field studies and network modeling methods. These efforts will likely yield new insights into the connections between social networks and life history, ecological change, and evolutionary dynamics. Births, deaths, and dispersal fundamentally shape societies. We consider how demography and behavior together generate complexity in social networks. For example, how do loss of partners affect behavior? How do new individuals integrate into a society? Considering such questions can lead to new links between social network theory, life history, ecological resilience, and evolutionary dynamics.}

Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.},

Some aspects of vocal variety have been shown to relate to sender characteristics and thus to convey a potential message to receivers.

Here, we tested the impact of two types of vocal variety: syllable diversity and syllable switching in the common chiffchaff, {$<$}em{$>$}Phylloscopus collybita{$<$}/em{$>$}, in two separate playback experiments. We found that syllable diversity was a relatively fixed trait and that variation among individuals was likely to reflect some male quality triggering responses of different intensity. Higher rates of syllable switching did not elicit different responses but songs after playback showed that it is a dynamic trait, potentially contributing to motivational signalling together with other song parameters. The resolution of analyses in our experiments revealed subtle changes in vocal features over time in unprecedented detail. This approach unveiled an intricate combination of various vocal features during the response that may complement each other during vocal interactions. We believe future studies would benefit from the same resolution, through which one can explore advanced levels in animal communication.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

A case in point is female birdsong that has received considerably less attention than male song. This holds even for well-studied species such as the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), an important model in evolutionary ecology. Although there have been anecdotal reports of female song from three populations, there are no quantitative studies on female song in this species. Here, we report systematic sampling from a population of individually marked blue tits over 3 years, revealing that females sang frequently throughout the sampling period. Notably, daytime singing of females occurred in functionally similar contexts as in males (agonistic, solo song, and alarm contexts) but females had lower song output than males and were not observed singing dawn song, while males showed long singing displays at dawn before copulations take place. Female and male song overlapped substantially in acoustic structure (i.e., same song types or peak frequency) but females had smaller individual song-type repertoires, shorter trills, and lower vocal consistency. Differential selection pressures related to functional differences in male and female song might explain the observed variation in acoustic structure. With the first quantitative study of female song in such a well-studied species, we hope to stimulate further investigations into the functions of female singing, especially in the Northern temperate zones where female song may have been overlooked, not only in this but perhaps in other monomorphic species.},

Consistent repetition of identical notes (vocal consistency) facilitates the assessment of neuromotor skills and is important in communication in birds. Most birdsong research has focused on song diversity as a signal of individual quality, which seems contradictory as repetition is extremely common in most species. Here we show that consistent repetition within songs is positively correlated with reproductive success in male blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). A playback experiment shows that females are sexually aroused by male songs with high levels of vocal consistency, which also peaks seasonally during the fertile period of the female, supporting the role of vocal consistency in mate choice. Male vocal consistency also increases with subsequent repetitions of the same song type (a warm-up effect) which conflicts with the fact that females habituate to repeated song, showing decreased arousal. Importantly, we find that switching song types elicits significant dishabituation within the playback, supporting the habituation hypothesis as an evolutionary mechanism driving song diversity in birds. An optimal balance between repetition and diversity may explain the singing style of many bird species and displays of other animals.},

  abstract = {The brown bear, the wolf, the lynx and other large carnivores are emblematic species for nature conservation. Since the establishment in 1992 of LIFE, the EU funding programme for the Environment, EU support for endangered large carnivore species and their habitats has focused on targeted practical conservation, restoration and manage- ment actions in the protected Natura 2000 network sites throughout the Union. Janez Poto\v{c}nik European Commissioner for the Environment European Commission But conservation of this type can be controversial. Attitudes towards large carnivores vary widely from village to village, region to region, and from country to country. Some see these apex predators as powerful symbols of wild nature and natural systems, while to others they are fundamentally a threat to lives and livelihoods. These conflicts need to be managed effectively for humans and large carnivores to coexist successfully in the long term. Awareness-raising has a vital role to play in this, and protect- ing livelihoods is vital, especially in areas that are being recolonised by large carnivores after an absence of decades or even centuries. As this publication illustrates, the LIFE programme has played a valuable role in demon- strating ways ofmanaging conflicts in the area of coexistence. Involving stakeholders such as stockbreeders and the hunting community has been important in reconciling conserva- tion and socio-economic goals. Some projects have been more successful than others, but valuable lessons can be learned from them all. Coming from a rural community in Slovenia where people, wolves and bears have cohab- ited for centuries, I can testify that coexistence is not only possible but brings with it innu- merable benefits. I hope that lessons from these LIFE actions can be used to improve the design and implementation of future projects. That way we can minimise conflicts between humans and large carnivores, and ensure the long-term conservation of a vital part of our natural heritage.},

Yet other work in this research stream and in the sociology of classification argues for the continued prevalence of genres as a meaningful tool through which creators, critics and consumers focus their attention in the topology of available works. Building from work in the study of categories and categorization we examine how boundary strength and internal differentiation structure the genre pairings of some 3 million musicians and groups. Using a range of network-based and statistical techniques, we uncover three musical "complexes," which are collectively constituted by 16 smaller genre communities. Our analysis shows that the musical universe is not monolithically organized but rather composed of multiple worlds that are differently structured-i.e., uncentered, single-centered, and multi-centered. \textcopyright{} 2016 Silver et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

Participants (N = 60) listened to 6 treatment conditions each consisting of 9 randomized monosyllabic digits. The digits were paired with (a) a familiar melody and pitch only, (b) a familiar melody and rhythm only, (c) a familiar melody with both pitch and rhythm, (d) an unfamiliar melody with pitch only, (e) an unfamiliar melody with rhythm only, and (f) an unfamiliar melody with both pitch and rhythm. The 6 different treatments were counterbalanced using a Latin square design in an attempt to control for order effects. Participants rated their state anxiety on a Likert-type scale before, midway through, and after the digits test. No statistically significant order, learning, or practice effects were found. A 3-way repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a statistically significant difference in digit recall performance across musical element conditions and groups. Results indicated that music majors outperformed nonmusic majors on the digit recall task. Participants were able to recall digits from the rhythm condition most accurately while recalling digits from pitch only and both pitch and rhythm conditions the least accurately. Graphic analysis of treatment as a function of sequential position indicated digit recall was best during conditions of primacy and recency. No main effects were found for the familiarity condition. Additionally, no main effects or interactions were found for the anxiety variable. The results of this study are congruent with existing working memory and music literature suggesting that pairing information with rhythm can facilitate recall, music majors outperform non-music majors, and recafl accuracy is best in positions of primacy and recency. Implications for practice in therapy and education are made as well as suggestions for future research.},

Do these processes of communication and cultural transmission affect the structure of category systems and their alignment across speakers? We examine novel category systems that emerge from communication, cultural transmission, and both processes combined. Communication alone leads to category systems that vary widely in their communicative effectiveness, and are no more structured or aligned than those created by individuals. When combined with cultural transmission, communication speeds up convergence on a learnable number of structured, aligned categories that are consistently communicatively effective. However, cultural transmission without communication eventually has similar results. Communication appears to be neither necessary nor sufficient for creating semantic category systems that are robustly effective for communication. Furthermore, category systems that emerge from cultural transmission are more aligned across speakers than the systems created by individuals, suggesting that cultural transmission allows individuals to coordinate their semantic systems more effectively than they can through shared perceptual biases alone.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, the effects of internalized AIDS stigmas have not been investigated in Africa, home to two-thirds of the more than 40 million people living with AIDS in the world. The current study examined the prevalence of discrimination experiences and internalized stigmas among 420 HIV-positive men and 643 HIV-positive women recruited from AIDS services in Cape Town, South Africa. The anonymous surveys found that 40\% of persons with HIV/AIDS had experienced discrimination resulting from having HIV infection and one in five had lost a place to stay or a job because of their HIV status. More than one in three participants indicated feeling dirty, ashamed, or guilty because of their HIV status. A hierarchical regression model that included demographic characteristics, health and treatment status, social support, substance use, and internalized stigma significantly predicted cognitive-affective depression. Internalized stigma accounted for 4.8\% of the variance in cognitive-affective depression scores over and above the other variables. These results indicate an urgent need for social reform to reduce AIDS stigmas and the design of interventions to assist people living with HIV/AIDS to adjust and adapt to the social conditions of AIDS in South Africa. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to promote this, the TEK of two peoples in Melanesia regarding four species of megapodes (Megapodiidae) was surveyed and compared with SEK. Results show TEK from observations of megapodes is reliable knowledge, being consistent with SEK, varying little within and among social groups and enabling people to answer most of the questions asked. TEK from interpreting observations was less reliable. Reliability of TEK varied according to the way in which the sexes and peoples interact with megapodes: for areas where groups interact most with megapodes, their knowledge is most reliable and vice versa. Successful integration of the two knowledge systems may improve the conservation of both biological and cultural diversity, while empowering indigenous peoples.},

This is a conservation success story, but the wolves also cause conflicts wherever they arrive. We have studied the situation in southeastern Norway and in the French Alps, where the conflict patterns are similar. Diverging interpretations of the situation are supported by narratives, and two varieties have become increasingly significant in both countries. Rumors about the secret reintroduction of wolves are common among wolf adversaries. Another narrative, important to the pro-wolf camp, is based on the notion that particular sheep husbandry practices (unattended rough grazing) are unique to either Norway or France-whereas there are in fact more similarities than differences. Yet, while the reintroduction-conspiracy rumors are ridiculed, the notion of unique national conflict patterns has achieved a status almost of official truth. Furthermore, the story about natural wolf recovery is itself a value-laden narrative, and not only "scientific fact." The different status of these narratives tell us something about power relations: Given their different social basis, it seems relevant to consider the national uniqueness image and the natural recovery theory as tightly interwoven with symbolic power and the reintroduction conspiracy rumors as similarly interwoven with patterns of cultural resistance.

Mitigation efforts normally target such conflict issues, which can apparently be addressed by means of economic compensation or incentives. However, many controversies have additional aspects that are fundamental to conflict development. These are rooted in social tensions and processes of social change that may have less to do with conservation per se. Therefore, mitigation efforts that address economic loss may lead to unintended consequences, in that they aggravate other aspects of the conflicts.

However, after a series of studies yielding conflicting results, research in the field slowed significantly. Recent findings, on how ecological factors may lead to divergence in both song and morphology, necessitate a re-examination. We focus primarily on species with learned song, examine conflicting results in the literature and propose some potential new directions for future studies. We believe an integrative approach, including an examination of the role of ecology in divergent selection, is essential for gaining insight into the role of song in the evolution of assortative mating. Habitat-dependent selection on both song and fitness-related characteristics can lead to parallel divergence in these traits. Song may, therefore, provide females with acoustic cues to find males that are most fit for a particular habitat. In analysing the role of song learning in reproductive divergence, we focus on post-dispersal plasticity in a conceptual framework. We argue that song learning may initially constrain reproductive divergence, while in the later stages of population divergence it may promote speciation.},

  abstract = {We briefly review the literature on social learning in birds, concluding that strong evidence exists mainly for predator recognition, song, mate choice and foraging. The mechanism of local enhancement may be more important than imitation for birds learning to forage, but the former mechanism may be sufficient for faithful transmission depending on the ecological circumstances. To date, most insights have been gained from birds in captivity. We present a study of social learning of foraging in two passerine birds in the wild, where we cross-fostered eggs between nests of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus and great tits, Parus major. Early learning causes a shift in the foraging sites used by the tits in the direction of the foster species. The shift in foraging niches was consistent across seasons, as showed by an analysis of prey items, and the effect lasted for life. The fact that young birds learn from their foster parents, and use this experience later when subsequently feeding their own offspring, suggests that foraging behaviour can be culturally transmitted over generations in the wild. It may therefore have both ecological and evolutionary consequences, some of which are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Royal Society.},

This chapter outlines the sorts of changes that may take place, at the level of elements, song types and repertoires, and also several distinct ways in which novel songs may arise in a population (immigration, innovation, invention, and improvisation). Much of the evidence is that such changes are random, and that their consequences are either neutral or negative, but some cases have been described where there have been progressive changes in song within a population. These are likely to stem from individuals adapting their songs to match a changing physical or social environment. The individual that generates variety and stands out from the crowd may also benefit through sexual selection, with a tension between innovation and conformity.},

  abstract = {Major life stressors, especially those involving interpersonal stress and social rejection, are among the strongest proximal risk factors for depression. In this review, we propose a biologically plausible, multilevel theory that describes neural, physiologic, molecular, and genomic mechanisms that link experiences of social-environmental stress with internal biological processes that drive depression pathogenesis. Central to this social signal transduction theory of depression is the hypothesis that experiences of social threat and adversity up-regulate components of the immune system involved in inflammation. The key mediators of this response, called proinflammatory cytokines, can in turn elicit profound changes in behavior, which include the initiation of depressive symptoms such as sad mood, anhedonia, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, and social-behavioral withdrawal. This highly conserved biological response to adversity is critical for survival during times of actual physical threat or injury. However, this response can also be activated by modern-day social, symbolic, or imagined threats, leading to an increasingly proinflammatory phenotype that may be a key phenomenon driving depression pathogenesis and recurrence, as well as the overlap of depression with several somatic conditions including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pain, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and neurodegeneration. Insights from this theory may thus shed light on several important questions including how depression develops, why it frequently recurs, why it is strongly predicted by early life stress, and why it often co-occurs with symptoms of anxiety and with certain physical disease conditions. This work may also suggest new opportunities for preventing and treating depression by targeting inflammation.},

We thus offer an unexpected generative mechanism for this central social phenomenon. Specifically, we establish that agents who have fixed needs to be distinct and adapt their positions to achieve distinctiveness goals, can nevertheless self-organize to a limiting state of absolute conformity. This seemingly paradoxical result is deduced formally from a small number of natural assumptions and is then explored at length computationally. Interesting departures from this conformity equilibrium are also possible, including divergence in positions. The effect of extremist minorities on these dynamics is discussed. A simple extension is then introduced, which allows the model to generate and maintain social diversity, including multimodal distinctiveness distributions. The paper contributes formal definitions, analytical deductions and counterintuitive findings to the literature on individual distinctiveness and social conformity.},

  abstract = {The potential for behaviours to spread via cultural transmission has profound implications for our understanding of social dynamics and evolution. Several studies have provided empirical evidence that local traditions can be maintained in animal populations via conformist learning (i.e. copying the majority). A conformist bias can be characterized by a sigmoidal relationship between a behavior's prevalence in the population and an individual's propensity to adopt that behavior. For this reason, the presence of conformist learning in a population is often inferred from a sigmoidal acquisition curve in which the overall rate of adoption for the behavior is taken as the dependent variable. However, the validity of sigmoidal acquisition curves as evidence for conformist learning has recently been challenged by models suggesting that such curves can arise via alternative learning rules that do not involve conformity. We review these models, and find that, in every case, the proposed alternative learning mechanisms relied on faulty or unrealistic assumptions. We therefore recommend that sigmoidal acquisition curves continue to be taken as evidence for conformist learning. Our paper also highlights the importance of understanding the generative processes of a model, rather than only focusing solely on the patterns produced. By studying these processes, our analysis suggests that current practices by empiricists have provided robust evidence for conformist transmission in both humans and non-human animals.},

Although it is generally accepted that temporal bone shape, like other aspects of morphology, has an underlying genetic component, the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors is unclear. To determine the impact of genetic differentiation and environmental variation on temporal bone morphology, we used three-dimensional geometric morphometric techniques to evaluate temporal bone variation in 11 modern human populations. Population differences were investigated by discriminant function analysis, and the strength of the relationships between morphology, neutral molecular distance, geographic distribution, and environmental variables were assessed by matrix correlation comparisons. Significant differences were found in temporal bone shape among all populations, and classification rates using cross-validation were relatively high. Comparisons of morphological distances to molecular distances based on short tandem repeats (STRs) revealed a significant correlation between temporal bone shape and neutral molecular distance among Old World populations, but not when Native Americans were included. Further analyses suggested a similar pattern for morphological variation and geographic distribution. No significant correlations were found between temporal bone shape and environmental variables: temperature, annual rainfall, latitude, or altitude. Significant correlations were found between temporal bone size and both temperature and latitude, presumably reflecting Bergmann's rule. Thus, temporal bone morphology appears to partially follow an isolation by distance model of evolution among human populations, although levels of correlation show that a substantial component of variation is unexplained by factors considered here.},

This study assessed the phylogenetic utility of six different human cranial regions, plus the entire cranium. Three-dimensional landmark data were collected for 83 landmarks from samples of skulls from 14 modern human populations. The data were subsequently divided into anatomical regions: basicranium, upper face, mandible, temporal bone, upper jaw, cranial vault, and a subset of points from around the entire cranium. Depictions of population molecular distances were calculated using published data on microsatellites for the same or closely related populations. DistanceSmith, H. F.

As the three-dimensional morphology of the temporal bone, upper face, basicranium, and entire cranium appear to consistently reflect genetic relationships in humans, especially with more reliability than the cranial vault, it would be preferable to focus on these regions when attempting to determine the genetic relationships of human specimens with no molecular data.},

V/CV patterns in the basicranium, temporal bone, and face are proportional within and among groups, which is consistent with a hypothesis of neutral evolution; however, mandibular morphology deviated from this pattern. Degree of intergroup similarity in facial, temporal bone, and mandibular morphology is significantly correlated with geographic distance; however, much of the variance remains unexplained.

  abstract = {A tenet of conservation palaeobiology is that knowledge of past extinction patterns can help us to better predict future extinctions. Although the future is unobservable, we can test the strength of this proposition by asking how well models conditioned on past observations would have predicted subsequent extinction events at different points in the geological past. To answer this question, we analyse the well-sampled fossil record of Cenozoic planktonic microfossil taxa (Foramanifera, Radiolaria, diatoms and calcareous nanoplankton). We examine how extinction probability varies over time as a function of species age, time of observation, current geographical range, change in geographical range, climate state and change in climate state. Our models have a 70\textendash 80\% probability of correctly forecasting the rank order of extinction risk for a random out-of-sample species pair, implying that determinants of extinction risk have varied only modestly through time. We find that models which include either historical covariates or account for variation in covariate effects over time yield equivalent forecasts, but a model including both is overfit and yields biased forecasts. An important caveat is that human impacts may substantially disrupt range-risk dynamics so that the future will be less predictable than it has been in the past.}

  abstract = {For many animals, long-range signalling is essential to maintain contact with conspecifics. In territorial species, individuals often have to balance signalling towards unfamiliar potential competitors (to solely broadcast territory ownership) with signalling towards familiar immedi- ate neighbours (to also maintain so-called ``dear enemy'' relations). Hence, to understand how signals evolve due to these multilevel relationships, it is important to understand how general signal traits vary in relation to the overall social environment. For many territorial songbirds dawn is a key signalling period, with several neighbouring individuals singing si- multaneously without immediate conflict. In this study we tested whether sharing a territory boundary, rather than spatial proximity, is related to similarity in dawn song traits between territorial great tits (Parus major) in a wild personality-typed population.Wecollected a large dataset of automatized dawn song recordings from 72 unique male great tits, during the fer- tile period of their mate, and compared specific song traits between neighbours and non- neighbours. Weshow here that both song rate and start time of dawn song were repeatable song traits. Moreover, neighbours were significantly more dissimilar in song rate compared to non-neighbours, while there was no effect of proximity on song rate similarity. Additional- ly, similarity in start time of dawn song was unrelated to sharing a territory boundary, but birds were significantly more similar in start time of dawn song when they were breeding in close proximity of each other.We suggest that the dissimilarity in dawn song rate between neighbours is either the result of neighbouring great tits actively avoiding similar song rates to possibly prevent interference, or a passive consequence of territory settlement prefer- ences relative to the types of neighbours. Neighbourhood structuring is therefore likely to be a relevant selection pressure shaping variation in territorial birdsong.},

Since individuals often differ consistently in general aggression and risk taking, the relative use of either close- or long-range territorial defence behaviour is likely to vary with the personality of the territory owner. Here we quantified the relationship between dawn song, a well-studied long-range signal, and responses to a close-range confrontation as well as how individuals in a territorial population vary in this relationship. For this we recorded dawn song and experimentally simulated territory intrusions via playbacks in wild personality-typed male great tits, Parus major. We show that males that sang at a higher rate at dawn also showed stronger vocal responses towards a simulated intruder, but spent less time in proximity to the intruder. Moreover, males with a higher exploration score, an established proxy for personality traits, showed the strongest vocal and spatial responses during the confrontation, yet exploration behaviour did not predict the dawn song rate. These findings highlight the importance of both confrontational and nonconfrontational territorial behaviours as well as personality for the social and territorial dynamics of animal populations.},

Moreover, social signals can directly affect proximity among conspecifics, by facilitating social attraction and repulsion. Social signals thus mediate many of the social networks we observe. Throughout, we discuss a broad range of signal types and interactions, yet with a focus on acoustic signals and show how they reflect and affect social relationships.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Studies of the cognitive abilities of animals aim to help us understand how they communicate, obtain resources, avoid danger and otherwise thrive in a given environment. But to what extent is cognitive ability a fixed trait in individuals? And can we answer this question by measuring performance on tests of cognitive ability? We tested the same 18 male song sparrows, {$<$}em{$>$}Melospiza melodia{$<$}/em{$>$}, once yearly, across three consecutive years, with tests of four putative cognitive traits and a test of neophobia. We also tested 19 females twice, once in the first year and once in the third year. All birds were hand-reared and tested in the laboratory. Analyses of both data sets indicate repeatability of neophobia but not of performance on the cognitive tests. In addition, correlations among cognitive performance, neophobia and song quality that were observed in the first year were not observed in subsequent rounds of testing. These results suggest that cognitive ability is not a fixed trait in individuals, or that the tests used do not accurately measure cognitive ability, or both. Conclusions drawn from a single round of cognitive tests should therefore be interpreted with caution in this species and in any species in which repeatability has not been verified.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

In bird song learning, one approach to exploring this interaction is to examine the songs rehearsed by young birds whose exposure to tutor models has been carefully controlled. Here, I analyzed the rehearsed repertoire in Nuttall's white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli) tutored with individual phrases of conspecific and heterospecific songs. The proportions of phrase types rehearsed indicate that the learning biases evident in crystallized song are manifest early on, suggesting preferential memorization rather than preferential retention during attrition. The proportion of songs beginning with whistles increased during song rehearsal and phrase sequence variability decreased, consistent with the idea that innate syntax specifications guide song rehearsal. Single-phrase tutored birds overproduced phrases to the same extent previously observed in birds tutored with full, normal song but retained fewer phrase types in their crystallized repertoires. This suggests that in this subspecies, acquired syntax information does not affect the number of phrase types memorized and rehearsed but does affect repertoire attrition at the end of the sensorimotor phase. I discuss these results with a focus on the action of innate templates in song development and subspecies differences in this process.},

  abstract = {Birdsong is an important sexually selected trait, and its acoustic features are socially transmitted in the process of song learning. The preference of some female songbirds for song complexity as measured by repertoire size has driven the evolution of many song traits and song-learning programs in males. If juvenile birds adopt the attractiveness of model birds by copying their repertoires, tutor choice in the early song-learning period should be crucial for future reproductive success. Thus, we hypothesized that the song quality of tutors influences the tutor choice of chicks in the Bengalese finch, Lonchura striata var. domestica. Each subject chick was reared by a foster pair in an individual breeding cage. At around the fledging period, we introduced another unrelated adult male (subtutor) into each cage to simulate the natural social environment in which chicks have opportunities to hear the songs of nonfather males after fledging. Subject chicks learned from both tutors when the total note repertoire size of the two models was small; they tended to learn from the subtutor when the father had a smaller note repertoire size. The acquired note repertoire size was not affected by whether subjects learned songs from the foster father or not. Song learning from the subtutor contributed to a larger note repertoire. Observed patterns in tutor choice, in particular song learning from a subtutor, could be an adaptive strategy that helps chicks compensate for exposure to smaller repertoire size in models. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

This prediction has been tested extensively using the complexity of birdsong as a model for trait elaboration. However, contradictory results have emerged. Some studies have demonstrated that males with large repertoires enjoy a reproductive advantage, whereas other studies have failed to support this prediction. To make general inferences from this mixed evidence, we quantitatively reviewed the relevant literature using a meta-analytic approach. The mean effect size for the song/mating success association was significant, but the effects were generally weak, affected by publication bias, confounded by uncontrolled variables, and differing across the traits examined. Effect sizes were heterogeneous across studies due to species-specific effects, differences in mating systems, and song phenotypes. The degree of association between song complexity and reproductive success was independent of the strength of sexual selection, as assessed by the degree of polygyny and extrapair paternity. Our results highlight the importance of considering various biological factors to understand the role of repertoires in mediating mating success in different species. \textcopyright{} 2011 The Author.},

Two processes are predicted to play key roles in how socially-transmitted information spreads in animal populations: the movement of individuals across the landscape and conformist social learning. We develop a model that, for the first time, explicitly integrates these processes to investigate their impacts on the spread of behavioural preferences. Our results reveal a strong interplay between movement and conformity in determining whether locally-variable traditions establish across a landscape or whether a single preference dominates the whole population. The model is able to replicate a real-world cultural diffusion experiment in great tits Parus major, but also allows for a range of predictions for the emergence of animal culture under various initial conditions, habitat structure and strength of conformist bias to be made. Integrating social behaviour with ecological variation will be important for understanding the stability and diversity of culture in animals.},

By acquiring comprehensive knowledge of the origin, diversification and historical demography of an intensively studied passerine species complex, Great Tit, we aim to test the regional variation of the Late Pleistocene glaciation impacts on this widely distributed bird lineage. Location: Eurasia and associated peninsulas and archipelagos. Taxa: Parus major species complex. Methods: Phylogeny, divergence times and demographic dynamics were estimated with Bayesian methods. Population structure, genetic diversity and correlation between genetic and physical distances were estimated based on mtDNA variation. Glacial-to-present distributional changes were assessed via ecological niche modelling (ENM). Results: Five major clades (Central Asia, Eastern Asia, Eastern Himalaya, Northern and Western Eurasia and Southern Asia) were detected, with divergence times ranging 1.57\textendash 0.50 million years ago. Genetic diversity values and Bayesian skyline plots suggest that the three eastern clades had a deeper population history. A more complex~geographic structure was observed in East Asia. Demographic expansion during the last glacial cycle was indicated for all five clades. ENM results showed broad conservatism of traits related to climate tolerances, and generally broader and more continuous distributional patterns under glacial conditions. Main Conclusions: The Great Tit complex probably originated in Southeast Asia. Geographic barriers, such as the deserts of Central Asia and the Qinghai\textendash Tibet Plateau appear to be related to the lineage divergence. Late Pleistocene climate cycles influenced both demographic dynamics and divergence, especially in terms of east\textendash west differences in relation to geographic complexity.},

  abstract = {In a wide range of bird species, females have been shown to express active preferences for males that sing more complex songs. Current sexual selection theory predicts that for this signal to remain an honest indicator of male quality, it must be associated with an underlying cost of development or maintenance. There has been considerable debate questioning the costs associated with song production and learning. Recently, the nutritional stress hypothesis proposed that song complexity could act as an indicator of early developmental history, since the song control nuclei in the brain are laid down early in life. Here we test the nutritional stress hypothesis, by investigating the effects of dietary stress on the quality of adult song produced. In addition, we tested the effects of elevated corticosterone during development on song production to test its possible involvement in mediating the effects of developmental stress. The results demonstrate that both dietary restriction and elevated corticosterone levels significantly reduced nestling growth rates. In addition, we found that experimentally stressed birds developed songs with significantly shorter song motif duration and reduced complexity. These results provide novel experimental evidence that complex song repertoires may have evolved as honest signals of male quality, by indicating early developmental rearing conditions.},

  abstract = {Understanding how animals interact with their physical and social environment is a major question in ecology, but separating between these factors is often challenging. Observed interaction rates may reflect social behaviour \textendash{} preferences or avoidance of conspecifics or certain phenotypes. Yet, environmental spatiotemporal heterogeneity also affects individual space use and interaction rates. For instance, clumped and ephemeral resources may force individuals to aggregate independently of sociality. Proximity-based social networks (PBSNs) are becoming increasingly popular for studying social structures thanks to the parallel improvement of biotracking technologies and network randomization methods. While current methods focus on swapping individual identities among network nodes or in the data streams that underlies the network (e.g. individuals movement paths), we still need better tools to distinguish between the contribution of sociality and other factors towards those interactions. We propose a novel method that randomizes path segments among different time stamps within each individual separately (Part I). Temporal randomization of whole path segments (e.g. full days) retains their original spatial structure while decoupling synchronization among individuals. This allows researchers to compare observed dyadic association rates with those expected by chance given explicit space use of the individuals in each dyad. Further, since environmental changes are commonly much slower than the duration of social interactions, we can differentiate between these two factors (Part II). First, an individual's path is divided into successive time windows (e.g. weeks), and days are randomized within each time window. Then, by exploring how the deviations between randomized and observed networks change as a function of time window length, we can refine our null model to account also for temporal changes in the activity areas. We used biased-correlated random walk models to simulate populations of socially indifferent or sociable agents for testing our method for both false-positive and negative errors. Applying the method to a data set of GPS-tracked sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) demonstrated its ability to reveal the social organization in free-ranging animals while accounting for confounding factors of environmental spatiotemporal heterogeneity. We demonstrate that this method is robust to sampling bias and argue that it is applicable for a wide range of systems and tracking techniques, and can be extended to test for preferential phenotypic assortment within PBSNs.},

Large-scale genomic studies of widespread species are useful for studying how the environment and demographic history shape patterns of genomic divergence, and with the continually decreasing cost of sequencing, such studies are now becoming feasible. Here, we carry out one of the most comprehensive surveys of genomic variation in a wild vertebrate to date; the great tit (Parus major) HapMap project. We screened ca 500,000 SNP markers across 647 individuals from 28 populations, spanning almost the entire geographic range of the European great tit subspecies. We found that genome-wide variation was consistent with a recent colonisation across Europe from a single refugium in the Balkans and/or Turkey, with bottlenecks and reduced genetic diversity in island populations. Differentiation across the genome was highly heterogeneous, with clear 'islands of differentiation' even among populations which are ostensibly panmictic. These islands of differentiation were consistently found in regions of low recombination, suggesting that background selection can rapidly promote population differentiation among even the most recently colonised populations. We also detected outlier regions that were unique to peripheral great tit populations, most likely as a result of recent directional selection at the range edges of this species. These 'unique' outlier regions contained candidate genes for morphology, stress response and colouration, supporting previous research in this species, and providing avenues for future investigation. Our study suggests that comprehensive screens of genomic variation in wild organisms can provide unique insights into evolution.},

Here, we introduce a model, the bayesian birth-death skyline plot, which explicitly estimates the rate of transmission, recovery, and sampling and thus allows inference of the effective reproductive number directly from genetic data. Our method allows these parameters to vary through time in a piecewise fashion and is implemented within the BEAST2 software framework. The method is a powerful alternative to the existing coalescent skyline plot, providing insight into the differing roles of incidence and prevalence in an epidemic. We apply this method to data from the United Kingdom HIV-1 epidemic and Egyptian hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic. The analysis reveals temporal changes of the effective reproductive number that highlight the effect of past public health interventions.},

Data are presented on the predator-prey ecology of red colobus monkeys Colobus badius tephrosceles) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, from 1982 through 1991. During this period chimpanzees were observed to kill 429 mammalian prey items, 350 of which were red colobus. Hunts were undertaken by chimpanzees in 71.5\% of encounters with red colobus, and in 52.2\% of all hunts at least one colobus was caught. Hunting occurred in all months, but its frequency peaked in the late dry season months of August and September, and was lowest in the rainy months of April and May. There was greater seasonality of hunting from 1982 to 1991 than previously reported for Gombe. Hunting success varied between 40\% in the rainy season and 65\% in the dry season. Sixty multiple kills of colobus were reported in which from two to seven colobus were killed. Approximately 75\% of all colobus caught were immatures; juveniles were the most preyed upon age class. Adult and adolescent male chimpanzees made 89.3\% of all kills; the 10.7\% of kills made by adult females was an increase over the 4\% figure for female kills reported in the preceding decade. Hunting showed a strong "binge" tendency, with the explanation for binges likely related to social rather than ecological factors. These results are discussed in light of earlier hunting data for Gombe chimpanzees, and compared with data from other chimpanzee field studies.},

Advances in 20th century evolutionary theory facilitated the development of evolutionary psychology and psychiatry as recognized areas of scientific investigation. In this century, advances in understanding the molecular basis of evolution, of the mind, and of psychopathology, offer the possibility of an integrated approach to understanding the proximal (psychobiological) and distal (evolutionary) mechanisms of interest to psychiatry and psychopharmacology. There is, for example, growing interest in the question of whether specific genetic variants mediate psychobiological processes that have evolutionary value in specific contexts, and of the implications of this for understanding the vulnerability to psychopathology and for considering the advantages and limitations of pharmacotherapy. The evolutionary value, and gene-environmental mediation, of early life programming is potentially a particularly rich area of investigation. Although evolutionary approaches to psychology and to medicine face important conceptual and methodological challenges, current work is increasingly sophisticated, and may prove to be an important foundational discipline for clinicians and researchers in psychiatry and psychopharmacology. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Acoustic signals serve communication within and across species throughout the animal kingdom. Studying the genetics, evolution, and neurobiology of acoustic communication requires annotating acoustic signals: segmenting and identifying individual acoustic elements like syllables or sound pulses. To be useful, annotations need to be accurate, robust to noise, and fast. We here introduce DeepAudioSegmenter (DAS), a method that annotates acoustic signals across species based on a deep-learning derived hierarchical presentation of sound. We demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and speed of DAS using acoustic signals with diverse characteristics from insects, birds, and mammals. DAS comes with a graphical user interface for annotating song, training the network, and for generating and proofreading annotations. The method can be trained to annotate signals from new species with little manual annotation and can be combined with unsupervised methods to discover novel signal types. DAS annotates song with high throughput and low latency for experimental interventions in realtime. Overall, DAS is a universal, versatile, and accessible tool for annotating acoustic communication signals.},

  abstract = {The question of whether religion played a role in the evolution of morality can be interpreted in different ways. I consider three. On the first interpretation, "morality" is understood as an evolved faculty for making moral judgments, where moral judgments are a special category of normative judgments. For seventy years, philosophers and psychologists have sought to characterize this special subset of normative judgments in a well-motivated way. But I maintain that these efforts have failed, and that the likely explanation is that there is no special subset of normative judgments of the sort that philosophers and psychologists have in mind. The upshot is that religion played no role in the evolution of the faculty for making moral judgments because there is no such faculty. A second interpretation of the question asks whether religion played a role in the evolution of norm psychology. I argue that the answer is probably no, because the evolution of norm psychology can be explained without appealing to religion. A third interpretation of the question asks whether religion played a role in the cultural (as opposed to biological) evolution of norms. Here, I contend, the answer is obviously yes.}

  abstract = {Automatic species classification of birds from their sound is a computational tool of increasing importance in ecology, conservation monitoring and vocal communication studies. To make classification useful in practice, it is crucial to improve its accuracy while ensuring that it can run at big data scales. Many approaches use acoustic measures based on spectrogram-type data, such as the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features which represent a manually-designed summary of spectral information. However, recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that features learnt automatically from data can often outperform manually-designed feature transforms. Feature learning can be performed at large scale and ``unsupervised'', meaning it requires no manual data labelling, yet it can improve performance on ``supervised'' tasks such as classification. In this work we introduce a technique for feature learning from large volumes of bird sound recordings, inspired by techniques that have proven useful in other domains. We experimentally compare twelve different feature representations derived from the Mel spectrum (of which six use this technique), using four large and diverse databases of bird vocalisations, classified using a random forest classifier. We demonstrate that in our classification tasks, MFCCs can often lead to worse performance than the raw Mel spectral data from which they are derived. Conversely, we demonstrate that unsupervised feature learning provides a substantial boost over MFCCs and Mel spectra without adding computational complexity after the model has been trained. The boost is particularly notable for single-label classification tasks at large scale. The spectro-temporal activations learned through our procedure resemble spectro-temporal receptive fields calculated from avian primary auditory forebrain. However, for one of our datasets, which contains substantial audio data but few annotations, increased performance is not discernible. We study the interaction between dataset characteristics and choice of feature representation through further empirical analysis.},

Many birds are most readily detected by their sounds, and thus, passive acoustic monitoring is highly appropriate. Yet acoustic monitoring is often held back by practical limitations such as the need for manual configuration, reliance on example sound libraries, low accuracy, low robustness, and limited ability to generalise to novel acoustic conditions. Here, we report outcomes from a collaborative data challenge. We present new acoustic monitoring datasets, summarise the machine learning techniques proposed by challenge teams, conduct detailed performance evaluation, and discuss how such approaches to detection can be integrated into remote monitoring projects. Multiple methods were able to attain performance of around 88\% area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), much higher performance than previous general-purpose methods. With modern machine learning, including deep learning, general-purpose acoustic bird detection can achieve very high retrieval rates in remote monitoring data, with no manual recalibration, and no pretraining of the detector for the target species or the acoustic conditions in the target environment.},

  abstract = {Animal vocalisations and natural soundscapes are fascinating objects of study, and contain valuable evidence about animal behaviours, populations and ecosystems. They are studied in bioacoustics and ecoacoustics, with signal processing and analysis an important component. Computational bioacoustics has accelerated in recent decades due to the growth of affordable digital sound recording devices, and to huge progress in informatics such as big data, signal processing and machine learning. Methods are inherited from the wider field of deep learning, including speech and image processing. However, the tasks, demands and data characteristics are often different from those addressed in speech or music analysis. There remain unsolved problems, and tasks for which evidence is surely present in many acoustic signals, but not yet realised. In this paper I perform a review of the state of the art in deep learning for computational bioacoustics, aiming to clarify key concepts and identify and analyse knowledge gaps. Based on this, I offer a subjective but principled roadmap for computational bioacoustics with deep learning: topics that the community should aim to address, in order to make the most of future developments in AI and informatics, and to use audio data in answering zoological and ecological questions.},

Witherspoon et al. ["Genetic similarities within and between human populations," Genetics 176:351-359 (2007)] proposed an index called the dissimilarity fraction (omega) to access in a quantitative way the validity of this statement for genetic systems. Witherspoon demonstrated that, as the number of loci increases, omega decreases to a point where, when enough sampling is available, the statement is false. In this study, we applied the dissimilarity fraction to Howells's craniometric database to establish whether or not similar results are obtained for cranial morphological traits. Although in genetic studies thousands of loci are available, Howells's database provides no more than 55 metric traits, making the contribution of each variable important. To cope with this limitation, we developed a routine that takes this effect into consideration when calculating omega. Contrary to what was observed for the genetic data, our results show that cranial morphology asymptotically approaches a mean omega of 0.3 and therefore supports the initial statement--that is, that individuals from the same geographic region do not form clear and discrete clusters--further questioning the idea of the existence of discrete biological clusters in the human species. Finally, by assuming that cranial morphology is under an additive polygenetic model, we can say that the population history signal of human craniometric traits presents the same resolution as a neutral genetic system dependent on no more than 20 loci.},

Why does public opinion tend to become more liberal over time? And why does public opinion change especially fast on certain issues, such as gay rights? We offer an explanation based on how different positions connect with different kinds of moral arguments. Based on a formal model of opinion dynamics, we predicted that positions better connected to harm and fairness arguments will be more popular among liberals and will become more popular over time among liberals and conservatives. Finally, the speed of this trend will be faster the better the position connects to harm and fairness arguments. These predictions all held with high accuracy in 44\,years of polling on moral opinions. The model explains the connection between ideology and moral opinions, and generates precise predictions for future opinion change.}

In line with previous research into content biases, a linear transmission chain design with 60 participants aged 18-52 was used to examine the encode-and-retrieve phase, while participants were asked to rank their interest in reading the story behind a headline and passing a story on for the other two phases. Legends which contained social information (Social Type), legends which contained survival information (Survival Type), and legends which contained both forms of information (Combined Type) were all recalled with significantly greater accuracy than control material, while Social and Combined Type legends were recalled with significantly greater accuracy than Survival Type legends. In another study with 30 participants aged 18-22, no significant differences were found between legend types in either the choose-to-receive phase or the choose-to-transmit phase.},

However, our general understanding of the relationship between dispersal ability, population differentiation and lineage diversification is limited. To address this issue, we sampled mitochondrial DNA variation within lineages of beetles and spiders across the Canary Islands to explore the relationships between dispersal ability, differentiation within lineages and diversification. We found positive relationships between population genetic structure and diversification for both beetles and spiders. Comparisons between dispersive and non-dispersive lineages revealed significant differences for both lineage differentiation and diversification. For both taxa, non-dispersive lineages had stronger population genetic structure. Genus-level endemic species richness and proxies for diversification rate within genera were higher in non-dispersive taxa for both beetles and spiders. Comparisons of average and maximum node divergences within genera suggest that species turnover may be higher in non-dispersive genera. Our results reveal a model where dispersal limitation may shape the diversity of lineages across evolutionary timescales by positively influencing intraspecific and species diversity, moderated by higher extinction rates compared to more dispersive lineages.},

To quantify its application and guide future studies, we conducted a systematic review of terrestrial PAM, covering 460 articles published in 122 journals (1992\textendash 2018). During this period, PAM-related studies showed above a fifteenfold rise in publication and covered three developing phases: establishment, expansion, and consolidation. Overall, the research was mostly focused on bats (50\%), occurred in northern temperate regions (65\%), addressed activity patterns (25\%), recorded at night (37\%), used nonprogrammable recorders (61\%), and performed manual acoustic analysis (58\%), although their applications continue to diversify. The future agenda should include addressing the development of standardized procedures, automated analysis, and global initiatives to expand PAM to multiple taxa and regions.},

  abstract = {Mainland China has undergone profound changes dating back to the nineteenth century, including a contemporary period of rapid modernization that began in the 1980s. The result has been dramatic social, cultural, and economic shifts impacting the daily lives of Chinese people. In this paper, we explore the psychological implications of sociocultural transformation in China, emphasizing two central themes. First, rising individualism: findings from social and developmental psychology suggest that China's rapid development has been accompanied by ever-increasing adherence to individualistic values. Second, rising rates of depression: findings from psychiatric epidemiology point to increasing prevalence of depression over this same time period, particularly in rural settings. We argue that links between sociocultural and psychological shifts in China can be usefully studied through a cultural psychology lens, emphasizing the mutual constitution of culture, mind, and brain. In particular, we note that the link between social change, individualism, and rising mental illness deserves careful attention. Our review suggests that shifting values and socialization practices shape emotion norms of concealment and display, with implications for depressive symptom presentation. The challenge comes with interpretation. Increasing prevalence rates of depression may indeed be a general response to the rapidity of sociocultural change, or a specific consequence of rising individualism but may also result from increasingly 'Western' patterns of symptom presentation, or improvements in diagnostic practice. We conclude by considering the challenges posed to standard universal models of psychological phenomena.},

The over-all aim was to test the hypothesis proposed by Anthony Marsella of 'severity related cross-cultural variability' suggesting that differences in symptom profile or personality patterns between cultures are most pronounced among healthy individuals and less so among individuals with severe mental disorders as they are perceived as more universal and less culturally determined. The over-all results showed that cross-cultural differences were in accordance with the proposed hypothesis. In addition, there were significant intracultural differences between the different diagnostic groups in both countries. The conclusion is that the Defense Mechanism Test and Partial Least Squares analysis seem to be powerful methods for personality assessment and potentially for cross-cultural research, and culture-specific norms in the Defense Mechanism Test must be employed.},

To investigate this potential for sexual selection via female choice, we assessed the relationships between male song variation and male mating and reproductive success of the Savannah Sparrow (\emph{Passerculus sandwichensis} (J.F. Gmelin, 1789)) over 3 years (2001\textendash 2003) in a population of Savannah Sparrows near London, Ontario, Canada. We measured song rate, as well as temporal and frequency attributes of song structure, as possible predictors of male quality, and then related these measures to attributes of male reproductive performance (mating and breeding success and territory size of males). We found significant correlations between male reproductive performance and several song features, such that the combined effects of two trill sections could potentially play an important role: males possessing such songs arrived and paired earlier and had higher fledging success. The results suggested that the trill segments of the song may signal important aspects of male quality. Possible reasons for significant roles of such songs in open-habitat birds are discussed.}

How do birds generate such a variety of sounds and what vocal gymnastics are required to produce them? The vocal system is the interface between the bird's brain and his song. Knowing how it functions, and coming to appreciate its limitations as well as its capabilities, is important in understanding vocal communication. Birdsong is the product of the carefully coordinated activity of many different muscles. Some of these are associated with the vocal organ but many belong to other muscle groups such as the respiratory system and the vocal tract. Together they convert nerve impulses from the brain into song. Less is known about the vocal mechanisms of non-songbirds, and they are mentioned only briefly to indicate the variety of avian vocal systems, and to provide a perspective from which to focus on the oscine songbirds. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In human language, the principle of compositionality governs how words are combined into a larger unit, the meaning of which depends on both the meanings of the words and the way in which they are combined. This linguistic capability, i.e., compositional syntax, has long been considered a trait unique to human language. Here, we review recent studies on call combinations in a passerine bird, the Japanese tit (Parus minor), that provide the first firm evidence for compositional syntax in a nonhuman animal. While it has been suggested that the findings of these studies fail to provide evidence for compositionality in Japanese tits, this criticism is based on misunderstanding of experimental design, misrepresentation of the importance of word order in human syntax, and necessitating linguistic capabilities beyond those given by the standard definition of compositionality. We argue that research on avian call combinations has provided the first steps in elucidating how compositional expressions could have emerged in animal communication systems.},

  abstract = {Recent calls for a revision of standard evolutionary theory (SET) are based partly on arguments about the reciprocal causation. Reciprocal causation means that cause-effect relationships are bi-directional, as a cause could later become an effect and vice versa. Such dynamic cause-effect relationships raise questions about the distinction between proximate and ultimate causes, as originally formulated by Ernst Mayr. They have also motivated some biologists and philosophers to argue for an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES). The EES will supposedly expand the scope of the Modern Synthesis (MS) and SET, which has been characterized as gene-centred, relying primarily on natural selection and largely neglecting reciprocal causation. Here, I critically examine these claims, with a special focus on the last conjecture. I conclude that reciprocal causation has long been recognized as important by naturalists, ecologists and evolutionary biologists working in the in the MS tradition, although it it could be explored even further. Numerous empirical examples of reciprocal causation in the form of positive and negative feedback are now well known from both natural and laboratory systems. Reciprocal causation have also been explicitly incorporated in mathematical models of coevolutionary arms races, frequency-dependent selection, eco-evolutionary dynamics and sexual selection. Such dynamic feedback were already recognized by Richard Levins and Richard Lewontin in their bok The Dialectical Biologist. Reciprocal causation and dynamic feedback might also be one of the few contributions of dialectical thinking and Marxist philosophy in evolutionary theory. I discuss some promising empirical and analytical tools to study reciprocal causation and the implications for the EES. Finally, I briefly discuss how quantitative genetics can be adapated to studies of reciprocal causation, constructive inheritance and phenotypic plasticity and suggest that the flexibility of this approach might have been underestimated by critics of contemporary evolutionary biology.},

  abstract = {Identifying biological mechanisms through which the experience of adversity emerges as individual risk for mental illness is an important step toward developing strategies for personalized treatment and, ultimately, prevention. Preclinical studies have identified epigenetic modification of gene expression as one such mechanism. Recent clinical studies have suggested that epigenetic modification, particularly methylation of gene regulatory regions, also acts to shape human brain function associated with risk for mental illness. However, it is not yet clear whether differential gene methylation as a function of adversity contributes to the emergence of individual risk for mental illness. Using prospective longitudinal epigenetic, neuroimaging and behavioral data from 132 adolescents, we demonstrate that changes in gene methylation associated with lower socioeconomic status (SES) predict changes in risk-related brain function. Specifically, we find that lower SES during adolescence is associated with an increase in methylation of the proximal promoter of the serotonin transporter gene, which predicts greater increases in threat-related amygdala reactivity. We subsequently demonstrate that greater increases in amygdala reactivity moderate the association between a positive family history for depression and the later manifestation of depressive symptoms. These initial results suggest a specific biological mechanism through which adversity contributes to altered brain function, which in turn moderates the emergence of general liability as individual risk for mental illness. If replicated, this prospective pathway may represent a novel target biomarker for intervention and prevention among high-risk individuals.},

Despite over a century of research on this puzzling and tragic behavior, and a recent increase in the number of treatments and intervention programs, it remains a global scourge. There is abundant research on suicidality in Western populations, but research on suicide among non-Western peoples is limited. Most notably, few studies analyze suicidality within small scale, non-industrial societies. Using ethnographic data from 53 cultures, this study tests two evolutionary theories of suicidal behavior: (1) deCatanzaro's inclusive fitness model, which proposes that successful suicide would increase the inclusive fitness of individuals with low reproductive potential who are a burden on kin, and (2) the bargaining model, which proposes that suicide attempts are a costly signal of need, with completed suicides an unfortunate byproduct. These models were operationalized into two sets of variables, which were used to code 474 textual accounts of suicide extracted from the Probability Sample of the Human Relations Area Files. Results indicate limited support for the inclusive fitness model, which might apply primarily to older adults in harsh environments, and widespread support for most elements of the bargaining model, especially among younger healthy adolescents and adults.},

For example, inbreeding is a rare event in most natural populations, and therefore many years of data are needed to estimate its effect on fitness. A key behaviour hypothesized to play an important role in avoiding inbreeding is natal dispersal. However, the functional significance of natal dispersal with respect to inbreeding has been much debated but subject to very few empirical tests. We analysed 44 years of data from a wild great tit Parus major population involving over 5000 natal dispersal events within Wytham Woods, UK. Individuals breeding with a relative dispersed over several-fold shorter distances than those outbreeding; within the class of inbreeding birds, increased inbreeding was associated with reduced dispersal distance, for both males and females. This led to a 3.4-fold increase (2.3-5, 95\% CI) in the likelihood of close (f=0.25) inbreeding relative to the population average when individuals dispersed less than 200m. In the light of our results, and published evidence showing little support for active inbreeding avoidance in vertebrates, we suggest that dispersal should be considered as a mechanism of prime importance for inbreeding avoidance in wild populations. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Royal Society.},

  abstract = {Acoustic recorders are commonly used to remotely monitor and collect data on bats (Order Chiroptera). These efforts result in many acoustic recordings that must be classified by a bat biologist with expertise in call classification in order to obtain useful information. The rarity of this expertise and time constraints have prompted efforts to automatically classify bat species in acoustic recordings using a variety of learning methods. There are several software programs available for this purpose, but they are imperfect and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service often recommends that a qualified acoustic analyst review bat call identifications even if using these software programs. We sought to build a model to classify bat species using modern computer vision techniques. We used images of bat echolocation calls (i.e., plots of the pulses) to train deep learning computer vision models that automatically classify bat calls to species. Our model classifies 10 species, five of which are protected under the Endangered Species Act. We evaluated our models using standard model validation procedures, and performed two external tests. For these tests, an entire dataset was withheld from the procedure before splitting the data into training and validation sets. We found that our validation accuracy (92\%) and testing accuracy (90\%) were higher than when we used Kaleidoscope Pro and BCID software (65\% and 61\% accuracy, respectively) to evaluate the same calls. Our results suggest that our approach is effective at classifying bat species from acoustic recordings, and our trained model will be incorporated into new bat call identification software: WEST-EchoVision.},

The present study aimed to demonstrate that multiple factors affect temporal control in the song production. We analyzed the song of Bengalese finches in various time ranges to address factors that affected the duration of acoustic elements (notes) and silent intervals (gaps). The gaps showed more jitter across song renditions than did notes. Gaps had longer duration in branching points of song sequence than in stereotypic transitions, and the duration of a gap was correlated with the duration of the note that preceded the gap. When looking at the variation among song renditions, we found notable factors in three time ranges: within-day drift, within-bout changes, and local jitter. Note durations shortened over time from morning to evening. Within each song bout note durations lengthened as singing progressed, while gap durations lengthened only during the late part of song bout. Further analysis after removing these drift factors confirmed that the jitter remained in local song sequences. These results suggest distinct sources of temporal variability exist at multiple levels on the basis of this note\textendash gap relationship, and that song comprised a mixture of these sources.},

  abstract = {Human communication systems evolve culturally, but the evolutionary mechanisms that drive this evolutionare notwell understood.Against a baseline that communication variants spread in a population following neutral evolutionary dynamics (also known as drift models), we tested the role of two cultural selection models: coordination- and content-biased. We constructed a parametrized mixed probabilistic model of the spread of communicative variants in four 8-person laboratory micro-societies engaged in a simple communication game. We found that selectionist models, working in combination, explain the majority of the empirical data. The best-fitting parameter setting includes an egocentric bias and a content bias, suggesting that participants retained their own previously used communicative variants unless they encountered a superior (content-biased) variant, in which case it was adopted. This novel pattern of results suggests that (i) a theory of the cultural evolution of human communication systems must integrate selectionist models and (ii) human communication systems are functionally adaptive complex systems. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Through cultural transmission, repeated learning by new individuals transforms cultural information, which tends to become increasingly compressible (Kirby, Cornish, \& Smith, ; Smith, Tamariz, \& Kirby, ). Existing diffusion chain studies include in their design two processes that could be responsible for this tendency: learning (storing patterns in memory) and reproducing (producing the patterns again). This paper manipulates the presence of learning in a simple iterated drawing design experiment. We find that learning seems to be the causal factor behind the increase in compressibility observed in the transmitted information, while reproducing is a source of random heritable innovations. Only a theory invoking these two aspects of cultural learning will be able to explain human culture's fundamental balance between stability and innovation.},

In recent years, researchers have begun to appeal to cultural evolution to explain the emergence of these structural properties. A particularly fruitful approach to this kind of explanation has been the use of laboratory experiments. These typically involve participants learning and interacting using artificially constructed communication systems. By observing the evolution of these systems in the lab, researchers have been able to build a bridge between individual cognition and population-wide emergent structure. We review these advances, and show how cultural evolution has been used to explain the origins of structure in linguistic signals, and in the mapping between signals and meanings.},

  abstract = {Music can be a powerful mnemonic device, as shown by a body of literature demonstrating that listening to text sung to a familiar melody results in better memory for the words compared to conditions where they are spoken. Furthermore, patients with a range of memory impairments appear to be able to form new declarative memories when they are encoded in the form of lyrics in a song, while unable to remember similar materials after hearing them in the spoken modality. Whether music facilitates the acquisition of completely new information, such as new vocabulary, remains unknown. Here we report three experiments in which adult participants learned novel words in the spoken or sung modality. While we found no benefit of musical presentation on free recall or recognition memory of novel words, novel words learned in the sung modality were more strongly integrated in the mental lexicon compared to words learned in the spoken modality. This advantage for the sung words was only present when the training melody was familiar. The impact of musical presentation on learning therefore appears to extend beyond episodic memory and can be reflected in the emergence and properties of new lexical representations.},

Their touching responses to the photographs were reinforced by food reward irrespective of which photographs they touched. The results revealed that all chimpanzees touched the photographs of humans significantly more than any other species, or phylogenetic families of primates. This tendency was consistent across different stimulus sets. The results suggest that the chimpanzees showed visual preference for the photographs of humans over those of their own species. The results also suggest that the degree of this visual preference was not in accordance with phylogenetic distance from the subjects' species, chimpanzees. The preference for humans was stronger in the case of the colored photographs than in monochromatic ones. All of the five chimpanzees had been in captivity for at least 16 years. They were reared by humans from just after their birth, or at least from 1.5 years old. Their preference might have developed through social experience, especially that during infanthood.},

Juvenile zebra finches readily copy the songs of the adult tutors that they interact with, but not the songs that they listen to passively through a speaker5,6, indicating that social cues generated by the tutor facilitate song imitation. Here we show that neurons in the midbrain periaqueductal grey of juvenile finches are selectively excited by a singing tutor and\textemdash by releasing dopamine in the cortical song nucleus HVC\textemdash help to encode the song representations of the tutor used for vocal copying. Blocking dopamine signalling in the HVC of the pupil during tutoring blocked copying, whereas pairing stimulation of periaqueductal grey terminals in the HVC with a song played through a speaker was sufficient to drive copying. Exposure to a singing tutor triggered the rapid emergence of responses to the tutor song in the HVC of the pupil and a rapid increase in the complexity of the song of the pupil, an early signature of song copying7,8. These findings reveal that a dopaminergic mesocortical circuit detects the presence of a tutor and helps to encode the performance of the tutor, facilitating the cultural transmission of vocal behaviour.},

Whereas a number of models can approximate the average distribution of recall error across target stimuli, attempts to model how error varies with the choice of target have been ad hoc. Here we adapt a neural model of working memory to provide a principled account of these stimulus-specific effects, by allowing each neuron's tuning function to vary according to the principle of efficient coding, which states that neural responses should be optimized with respect to the frequency of stimuli in nature. For orientation, this means incorporating a prior that favors cardinal over oblique orientations. While continuing to capture the changes in error distribution with set size, the resulting model accurately described stimulus-specific variations as well, better than a slot-based competitor. Efficient coding produces a repulsive bias away from cardinal orientations, a bias that ought to be sensitive to changes in the environmental statistics. We subsequently tested whether shifts in the stimulus distribution influenced response bias to uniformly sampled target orientations in human subjects (of either sex). Across adaptation blocks, we manipulated the distribution of nontarget items by sampling from a bimodal congruent (incongruent) distribution with peaks centered on cardinal (oblique) orientations. Preadaptation responses were repulsed away from the cardinal axes. However, exposure to the incongruent distribution produced systematic decreases in repulsion that persisted after adaptation. This result confirms the role of prior expectation in generating stimulus-specific effects and validates the neural framework.},

We call this effect fraternal inhibition. Fraternal inhibition was avoided by members of a clutch that developed the song first. To our surprise, this role commonly fell to one of the younger birds in the clutch. Early song learning may influence fitness since individuals that produced the most complete imitations also tended to induce more egg laying.},

Cultures vary in stability and diversity (polymorphism), ranging from chaotic or drifting cultures, through cumulative polymorphic cultures, to stable monolithic cultures with high conformity levels. What features can sustain polymorphism, preventing cultures from collapsing into either chaotic or highly conforming states? We investigate this question by integrating studies across two quite separate disciplines: The emergence of song cultures in birds, and the spread of public opinion and social conventions in humans. In songbirds, the learning process has been studied in great detail, while in human studies the structure of social networks has been experimentally manipulated on large scales. In both cases, the manner in which communication signals are compressed and filtered - either during learning or while traveling through the social network - can affect culture polymorphism and stability. We suggest a simple mechanism of a shifting balance between converging and diverging social forces to explain these effects. Understanding social forces that shape cultural evolution might be useful for designing agile communication systems, which are stable and polymorphic enough to promote gradual changes in institutional behavior.},

Although imitation should drive convergence within a group and divergence through drift between groups, zebra finch songs sustain high diversity within a colony, but mild variation across colonies. We investigated this phenomenon by analyzing vocal learning statistics in 160 tutor-pupil pairs from a large breeding colony. Song imitation is persistently accurate in some families, but poor in others. This is not attributed to genetic differences, as fostered pupils copied their tutors' songs as accurately or poorly as biological pupils. Rather, pupils of tutors with low song diversity make more improvisations compared to pupils of tutors with high song diversity. We suggest that a frequency dependent balanced imitation prevents extinction of rare song elements and overabundance of common ones, promoting repertoire diversity within groups, while constraining drift across groups, which together prevents the collapse of vocal culture into either complete uniformity or chaos.},

In this study, we argue that the overlap of the disciplines of bioacoustics, vocal communication, and conservation behavior\textemdash thus, ``acoustic conservation behavior''\textemdash has much to offer threatened species monitoring. In particular, vocalizations can serve as indicators of behavioral states and contexts that provide insight into populations as it relates to their conservation. We explore the information available from monitoring species' vocalizations that relate to reproduction and recruitment, alarm and defense, and social behavior, and how this information could translate into potential conservation benefits. While there are still challenges to processing acoustic data, we conclude that acoustic conservation behavior may improve threatened species monitoring where vocalizations reveal behaviors that are informative for management and decision-making.},

At the same time, foraging birds avoided areas with low or high but not mid-range canopy cover only in the dense deciduous forest, whereas in the more open coniferous forest, females used areas, which vary widely in the amount of canopy coverage. Females employing this foraging behaviour raised larger broods on average. Our results suggest that foraging microhabitat selection in forest passerines is a complicated process subject to diverse and interacting effects of habitat characteristics other than simply a habitat's position on a food-richness axis. Moreover, the study demonstrates how using a micro-scale approach can reveal subtle, but significant, habitat selection mechanisms that remain hidden at a macro-scale level.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

This casts doubt on the theory that the differences in instrumental rhythm between these nations are due to differences in speech rhythm.},

Whereas most research has focussed on receiver biases in the sensory system, more recent studies show that biases can also arise from learning about signals.

  abstract = {Both language and music are universal and characteristic for humans. The evolution of the cognitive abilities underlying language and music are widely debated. A core question is whether these abilities find their origins in a modification or extension of general cognitive abilities for processing auditory input also present in other species. If so, comparative studies of nonhuman animals should reveal similarities in processing abilities. In this paper, we review some examples of such studies. We focus on whether birds (in particular zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, and budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulates) can detect structural patterns based on relational rather than on physical similarities among auditory stimuli \textendash{} an essential ability for processing and producing language and music. We briefly discuss why birds are suitable model species. Next, we discuss three domains of pattern detection: the ability to (1) detect `grammatical rules' underlying sound strings; (2) perceive regular rhythms and (3) spontaneously group separate sounds into a larger pattern. In all of these there is evidence that birds show some ability to detect relational patterns. However, there is also variation between species: while budgerigars show relational rule learning, zebra finches attend to local physical similarities between sound strings used for training and testing. For rhythm detection, zebra finches and budgerigars show no clear differences. However, a broader comparison indicates that here too differences are present in the extent to which different bird species attend to relational patterns or to local features. Finally, spontaneous grouping of sounds was shown in zebra finches. The clear variation among bird species in their perceptual and cognitive abilities, in combination with their accessibility for experimental studies, provides opportunities to study the variation in auditory processing mechanisms and how these evolved. This may also provide hypotheses for the evolution of these abilities in humans.},

  abstract = {The study of vocal production learning in birds is heavily biased towards oscine songbirds, making the songbird model the reference for comparative studies. However, as vocal learning was probably ancestral in songbirds, interspecific variations might all be variations on a single theme and need not be representative of the nature and characteristics of vocal learning in other bird groups. To assess the possible mechanisms of vocal learning and its evolution therefore requires knowledge about independently evolved incidences of vocal learning. This review examines the presence and nature of vocal production learning in non-songbirds. Using a broad definition of vocal learning and a comparative phylogenetic framework, I evaluate the evidence for vocal learning and its characteristics in non-oscine birds, including well-known vocal learners such as parrots and hummingbirds but also (putative) cases from other taxa. Despite the sometimes limited evidence, it is clear that vocal learning occurs in a range of different, non-related, taxa and can be caused by a variety of mechanisms. It is more widespread than often realized, calling for more systematic studies. Examining this variation may provide a window onto the evolution of vocal learning and increase the value of comparative research for understanding vocal learning in humans.

Chimpanzee cultural traditions represent behavioural biases of different populations, all within the species' existing cognitive repertoire (what we call the 'zone of latent solutions') that are generated by founder effects, individual learning and mostly product-oriented (rather than process-oriented) copying. Human culture, in contrast, has the distinctive characteristic that it accumulates modifications over time (what we call the 'ratchet effect'). This difference results from the facts that (i) human social learning is more oriented towards process than product and (ii) unique forms of human cooperation lead to active teaching, social motivations for conformity and normative sanctions against non-conformity. Together, these unique processes of social learning and cooperation lead to humans' unique form of cumulative cultural evolution.},

  abstract = {Background: White-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar) are small Asian apes known for living in stable territories and producing loud, elaborate vocalizations (songs), often in well-coordinated male/female duets. The female great call, the most conspicuous phrase of the repertoire, has been hypothesized to function in intra-sexual territorial defense. We therefore predicted that characteristics of the great call would correlate with a caller's physical condition, and thus might honestly reflect resource holding potential (RHP). Because measurement of RHP is virtually impossible for wild animals, we used age as a proxy, hypothesizing that great call climaxes are difficult to produce and maintain over time, and that older adults will therefore perform lower quality great calls than young adults. To test this we analyzed the great call climaxes of 15 wild lar gibbon females at Khao Yai National Park, Thailand and 2 captive females at Leo Conservation Center, Greenwich, CT. Results: Findings show that call climaxes correlate with female age, as young animals (n = 8, mean age: 12.9 years) produced climaxes with a higher frequency range (delta F0), maximum F0 frequency and duty cycle than old animals (n = 9, mean age: 29.6 years). A permuted discriminant function analysis also correctly classified calls by age group. During long song bouts the maximum F0 frequency of great call climaxes' also decreased. Additional data support the hypothesis that short high notes, associated with rapid inhalation as an individual catches its breath, reflect increased caller effort. Older females produced more high notes than younger females, but the difference only approached statistical significance, suggesting that calling effort may be similar across different ages. Finally, for the first time in this species, we measured peak intensity of calls in captive females. They were capable of producing climaxes in excess of 100 dB at close range (2.7 m). Conclusions: Age and within-bout differences in the lar gibbon great call climax suggest that call features correlate with physical condition and thus the call may have evolved as an honest signal in the context of intra-sexual territorial defense and possibly also in male mate choice via sexual selection, although further testing of these hypotheses is necessary.

Here we report a large sample of 270 fragments of intentionally marked ostrich eggshell from the Howiesons Poort at Diepkloof Rock Shelter, Western Cape, South Africa. Dating from approximately 60,000 years ago, these pieces attest to an engraving tradition that is the earliest reliable evidence of what is a widespread modern practice. These abstract linear depictions were made on functional items (eggshell containers), which were curated and involved in daily hunter-gatherer life. The standardized production of repetitive patterns, including a hatched band motif, suggests a system of symbolic representation in which collective identities and individual expressions are clearly communicated, suggesting social, cultural, and cognitive underpinnings that overlap with those of modern people.},

This issue is present in fraud detection, network intrusion detection, medical diagnostics, and a number of other fields where negatively labeled instances significantly outnumber positively labeled instances. Modern machine learning techniques struggle to deal with imbalanced data by focusing on minimizing the error rate for the majority class while ignoring the minority class. The goal of our paper is demonstrate the effects of class imbalance on classification models. Concretely, we study the impact of varying class imbalance ratios on classifier accuracy. By highlighting the precise nature of the relationship between the degree of class imbalance and the corresponding effects on classifier performance we hope to help researchers to better tackle the problem. To this end, we carry out extensive experiments using 10-fold cross validation on a large number of datasets. In particular, we determine that the relationship between the class imbalance ratio and the accuracy is convex.},

To overcome this problem, the authors propose a deep metric learning-based framework that provides effective classification, even when only a small number of per-class training examples are available. The proposed framework utilizes a multiscale convolutional neural network and the proposed dynamic variant of the triplet loss to learn a transformation space where intra-class separation is minimized and inter-class separation is maximized by a dynamically increasing margin. The process of learning this transformation is known as deep metric learning. The triplet loss analyzes three examples (referred to as a triplet) at a time to perform deep metric learning. The number of possible triplets increases cubically with the dataset size, making triplet loss more suitable than the cross-entropy loss in data-scarce conditions. Experiments on three different publicly available datasets show that the proposed framework performs better than existing bioacoustic classification methods. Experimental results also demonstrate the superiority of dynamic triplet loss over cross-entropy loss in data-scarce conditions. Furthermore, unlike existing bioacoustic classification methods, the proposed framework has been extended to provide open-set classification.},

Here we present DNA sequences from 16 noncoding autosomal loci from 15 western gorillas and 3 eastern gorillas, including 2 noninvasively sampled free-ranging individuals. We find that the genetic diversity of gorillas is similar to that of chimpanzees but almost twice as high as that of bonobos and humans. A significantly positive Fu \& Li's D was observed for western gorillas, suggesting a complex demographic history with a constant, long-term population size and ancestral population structure. Among different population-split scenarios, our data suggest a complex history of western and eastern gorillas including an initial population split at around 0.9-1.6 MYA and subsequent, primarily male-mediated gene flow until approximately 80,000-200,000 years ago. Furthermore, simulations revealed that more gene flow took place from eastern to western gorilla populations than vice versa.},

This study develops mathematical models to investigate the consequences of differential mutation rates on the ability of groups of information units to survive over many generations. We examined the ability of groups composed of connected units to live on despite the occurrence of deleterious mutations that occur at probabilities ranging from 10\textsuperscript{-1} to 10\textsuperscript{-6}. It appears that the degree of connection between units should be high enough for groups to persist across generations, but this alone did not ensure their survival; when groups of units were limited in size and subjected to high mutation rates, they did not survive for very long. By contrast, a significant proportion of groups were able to survive numerous generations if mutation rates were low and/or group size was large. The results revealed that the mean number of surviving generations was minimized for certain sizes of groups. When allowing information units to duplicate at each generation, simulation showed that a great number of groups avoided extinction even when mutating at the rate of cultural change if the initial group size was large and the duplication rate was high enough to counteract the consequences of environmental perturbations. The modelling described in this study sets out the conditions under which groups of units can survive along generations. It should serve as a basis for further investigations about the links between processes of biological and cultural changes.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {We set out an account of how self-domestication plays a crucial role in the evolution of language. In doing so, we focus on the growing body of work that treats language structure as emerging from the process of cultural transmission. We argue that a full recogn\c{c} ition of the importance of cultural transmission fundamentally changes the kind of questions we should be asking regarding the biological basis of language structure. If we think of language structure as reflecting an accumulated set of changes in our genome, then we might ask something like, "What are the genetic bases of language structure and why were they selected?" However, if cultural evolution can account for language structure, then this question no longer applies. Instead, we face the task of accounting for the origin of the traits that enabled that process of structure-creating cultural evolution to get started in the first place. In light of work on cultural evolution, then, the new question for biological evolution becomes, "How did those precursor traits evolve?" We identify two key precursor traits: (1) the transmission of the communication system through learning; and (2) the ability to infer the communicative intent associated with a signal or action. We then describe two comparative case studies-the Bengalese finch and the domestic dog-in which parallel traits can be seen emerging following domestication. Finally, we turn to the role of domestication in human evolution. We argue that the cultural evolution of language structure has its origin in an earlier process of self-domestication.},

Hence, there is a need for objective, generalizable methods that detect underlying patterns in these data, categorize sounds into distinct groups, and quantify similarities between them. Among all computational methods that have been proposed to accomplish this, neighborhood-based dimensionality reduction of spectrograms to produce a latent-space representation of calls stands out for its conceptual simplicity and effectiveness. Using a dataset of manually annotated meerkat (Suricata suricatta) vocalizations, we demonstrate how this method can be used to obtain meaningful latent space representations that reflect the established taxonomy of call types. We analyze strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach, give recommendations for its usage and show application examples, such as the classification of ambiguous calls and the detection of mislabeled calls. All analyses are accompanied by example code to help researchers realize the potential of this method for the study of animal vocalizations.},

The lack of consensus on units arises from the fact that units generated by the same methods at different levels of organization are given different names. A method for designating bird song units is offered for discussion which uses the concept of level of organization to stress the fundamental unanimity of method. It is hoped that consideration of this method will lead ultimately to greater standardization in the protocols by which researchers generate and name bird song units.},

  abstract = {A central debate in cognitive science concerns the nativist hypothesis, the proposal that universal features of behavior reflect a biologically determined cognitive substrate: For example, linguistic nativism proposes a domain-specific faculty of language that strongly constrains which languages can be learned. An evolutionary stance appears to provide support for linguistic nativism, because coordinated constraints on variation may facilitate communication and therefore be adaptive. However, language, like many other human behaviors, is underpinned by social learning and cultural transmission alongside biological evolution. We set out two models of these interactions, which show how culture can facilitate rapid biological adaptation yet rule out strong nativization. The amplifying effects of culture can allow weak cognitive biases to have significant population-level consequences, radically increasing the evolvability of weak, defeasible inductive biases; however, the emergence of a strong cultural universal does not imply, nor lead to, nor require, strong innate constraints. From this we must conclude, on evolutionary grounds, that the strong nativist hypothesis for language is false. More generally, because such reciprocal interactions between cultural and biological evolution are not limited to language, nativist explanations for many behaviors should be reconsidered: Evolutionary reasoning shows how we can have cognitively driven behavioral universals and yet extreme plasticity at the level of the individual-if, and only if, we account for the human capacity to transmit knowledge culturally. Wherever culture is involved, weak cognitive biases rather than strong innate constraints should be the default assumption.},

By means of a two-interval duration discrimination task in the sub-second range, we investigated whether participants overestimate the duration of red stimuli in comparison to blue stimuli, while controlling for differences in brightness (individual adjustments by means of flicker photometry) and saturation (colorimetric adjustment in terms of the CIELAB color space). Surprisingly, our results show an overestimation of the duration of blue compared to red stimuli (indicated by a shift of the point of subjective equality), even though the red stimuli were rated as being more arousing. The precision (variability) of duration judgments, i.e., the duration difference limen, did not differ between red and blue stimuli, questioning an explanation in terms of attentional processes.},

We studied the scent attractiveness to the opposite sex of t-shirts worn for 2 nights' sleep. Our results indicate that the two olfactory systems are independent. We repeated previous results from studies of the scent of symmetry. We repeated previous results from MHC research in part; men, but not women, showed a preference for t-shirts with the scent of MHC dissimilarity. Women's scent ratings of t-shirts were uncorrelated with the wearer's MHC dissimilarity and allele frequency, but positively correlated with the wearer's MHC heterozygosity. Fertile women did not exhibit any MHC trait preferences. Women's preference for the scent of men who were heterozygous for MHC alleles may be stronger in women who are at infertile cycle points. Men preferred the scent of common MHC alleles, which may function to avoid mates with rare alleles that exhibit gestational drive. Men also preferred the scent of women at fertile cycle points. The scent of facially attractive women, but not men, was preferred. Neither FA nor facial attractiveness in either sex correlated with MHC dissimilarity to others, MHC heterozygosity, or MHC allelic rarity.},

If heritable differences in male viability existed in the evolutionary past, selection could have favoured female adaptations (e.g. orgasm) that biased sperm competition in favour of males possessing heritable fitness indicators. Accumulating evidence suggests that low fluctuating asymmetry is a sexually selected male feature in a variety of species, including humans, possibly because it is a marker of genetic quality. Based on these notions, the proportion of a woman's copulations associated with orgasm is predicted to be associated with her partner's fluctuating asymmetry. A questionnaire study of 86 sexually active heterosexual couples supported this prediction. Women with partners possessing low fluctuating asymmetry and their partners reported significantly more copulatory female orgasms that were reported by women with partners possessing high fluctuating asymmetry and their partners, even with many potential confounding variables controlled. The findings are used to examine hypotheses for female orgasm other than selective sperm retention. \textcopyright{} 1995.},

If predators must eat prey to associate novel warning signals with unpalatability, how can aposematic prey ever evolve? Using experiments with great tits (\emph{Parus major}) as predators, we show that social transmission enhances the acquisition of avoidance by a predator population. Observing another predator's disgust towards tasting one novel conspicuous prey item led to fewer aposematic than cryptic prey being eaten for the predator population to learn. Despite reduced personal encounters with unpalatable prey, avoidance persisted and increased over subsequent trials. Next we use a mathematical model to show that social transmission can shift the evolutionary trajectory of prey populations from fixation of crypsis to fixation of aposematism more easily than was previously thought. Therefore, social information use by predators has the potential to have evolutionary consequences across ecological communities.}

  abstract = {1. The songs and other vocalisations of birds are of theoretical interest to zoologists and psychologists (1) as social communication systems and as a ``language''; (2) as specific and inter-specific recognition marks; (3) as a problem in the inheritance and genetical control of elaborate behaviour patterns; and (4) as a problem in the acquistion of complex behaviour patterns by individual learning. The last two constitute the main objects of this work. 2. The Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs was chosen as the main subject of investigation because its song displays both inherited and individually learned components, the relation between which is of particular interest. It is considered that neither a chain reflex type of theory nor one of reflex conditioning in the ordinary sense will provide satisfactory explanation of song production. 3. The characteristics and normal limits of variation of song of wild F. c. coelebs and F. c. gengleri are described and illustrated. There is no certain means of distinguishing the songs of these two subspecies but fairly consistent local differences occur. A wild male Chaffinch usually has more than one song type and may have as many as six. Full song is practically unknown in the female. 4. The song of insular species and sub-species and of artificially isolated populations tend to be simpler and less variable than examples from the Continent, possibly because, in a less dense population in an ecologically simpler environment, an individually distinctive territorial proclamation will not be so important for breeding success. 5. Experiments with F. c. gengleri were carried out in aviaries, bird rooms and cages. None of these techniques had any seriously adverse effect on the drive to sing. The onset of song could be controlled experimentally by crowding, by artificial control of daily illumination in a light-proof room and by injection of testosterone propionate. 6. Birds caught as juveniles in their first autumn and isolated until the summer following produced nearly normal songs that are almost as elaborate as are those of wild Chaffinches. If such birds, instead of being individually isolated, are kept together in groups in such a manner that they can hear only the songs of the members of their own group, these birds (as a result of counter-singing) copy one another and so come to produce a fairly uniform community pattern. Close matching of the final phrase of the song is particularly evident. 7. Birds which have been hand-reared in auditory isolation from the fifth day of life produce extremely simple songs which represent the inborn component of the specific song. If such Kaspar Hauser birds are themselves grouped together in isolated communities from the third to the thirteenth month of life, each group will-during the period February to May\textemdash build up, by mutual stimulation and imitation, complex but highly abnormal songs quite dissimilar from those of normal wild Chaffinches. From this it is clear that in the wild young Chaffinches learn some features of the song from their male parents or from other adults during the first few weeks of life. But most of the finer detail of the song is learnt by the young bird when, in its first breeding season, it first comes to sing in competition with neighbouring territory holders. There is little doubt that this is the way in which local song-dialects are built up and perpetuated. Full Chaffinch song is thus an integration of inborn and learned song patterns, the former constituting the basis for the latter. 8. The subsong of the Chaffinch is of low intensity, entirely different in structure from the full song, and contains a much bigger range of frequencies. It seems to have no communicatory function. It is characteristic of the early spring of first-year birds, and also of low but increasing production of sex hormones in birds of all ages. It provides in some degree the raw material out of which, by practice and by the elimination of unwanted extremes of frequency, the full song is crystallised. 9. The use of call notes, which are innate, as components of subsong and full song is described. Call notes are more evident in the songs of Kaspar Hauser birds than they are in the songs of normal birds. This is presumably an expression of the reduced auditory experience of the hand-reared isolated birds. 10. Chaffinches are not ``imitative'' birds in that they do not normally copy anything but sounds of Chaffinch origin. Once a Chaffinch has heard Chaffinch song as a young bird in the wild, it appears to have learnt enough about it to refuse to copy any sound pattern which departs far from the normal, i.e. it will learn only the fine individual variations of the songs of other Chaffinches. So, in the wild, Chaffinches practically never, in their full songs, imitate anything but other Chaffinches. Kaspar Hauser birds will learn songs of far greater abnormality provided the tonal quality is not too different from that of Chaffinch song. Voices as ``abnormal'' as that of a Canary may be learned by hand-reared birds and very occasionally by wild birds but when this happens the alien notes are kept as components of the non-communicative subsong only; the full song is not contaminated with them. If the tonal quality is sufficiently close to that of the Chaffinch, as with the song of the Tree Pipit and as with artificial songs constructed from genuine Chaffinch notes and played to the hand-reared birds by means of the ``Song Tutor'', they will be learned at least to some extent and the learned pattern will become part of the bird's full song. 11. Counter-singing that occurs between birds in adjacent territories is an important factor in stimulating and restricting the imitative abilities of Chaffinches. When a Chaffinch has acquired more than one song type, each song outburst consists of a sequence of one song type followed by a sequence of another. This can be largely understood on the basis of the inter-action of the self-stimulating and self-inhibitory effects which are a concomitant of each song type. When songs are played back to a Chaffinch we find that those songs which it uses most frequently itself are the most effective in evoking song. A Chaffinch in the wild will thus tend to reply to a neighbour with that song of its own repertoire which most nearly resembles the song of its rival. 12. It is suggested that with the more ``imitative'' finches such as Bullfinch, Hawfinch and to some extent Greenfinch, the song, while functional in co-ordinating the breeding cycle and behaviour of the mated pair, is of less importance as a territorial proclamation. Thus in some respects it resembles the subsong rather than the full song of the Chaffinch and similarly contamination with alien notes can be tolerated to an extent which might be highly disadvantageous in a highly territorial song. A preliminary study of a number of species of ``Buntings'' shows that many of the species, e.g. Reed and Corn Buntings (Emberiza schoeniclus and E. calandra) have songs which are highly stereotyped and completely innate. The song of the Yellow Bunting E. citrinella appears to consist of an integration of innate and learned components much as in the Chaffinch. The Buntings as a whole have highly territorial songs. 13. Apart from a very few and partial exceptions, Chaffinches can only learn song patterns during the first 13 months of life and towards the end of this time there is a peak period of learning activity of a few weeks during which a young Chaffinch may learn, as a result of singing in a territory, the fine details of as many as six different songs. This special period of high learning ability is brought to an abrupt close by internal factors. This restriction of learning ability to a particular type of object and to a sharply defined sensitive period recalls the phenomenon of imprinting. 14. The inborn recognition and performance of the specific song pattern by the Chaffinch involves (a) duration of approximately 2 1/2 secs., (b) interval between songs of approximately 10\textendash 20 secs., (c) tonal quality (though this last may have been learned by the bird's experience of the qualities of its own voice). The readiness with which the bird learns to divide its song into three sections and learns to attach a simple flourish to the end as an appropriate termination suggests that there may be a very imperfectly inherited tendency to respond to and perform these features of the normal song which is revealed as soon as the singer is stimulated by hearing another bird.

  abstract = {The evolution and function of female trait exaggeration in species with traditional sex roles are poorly understood. Competition for social and ecological resources, rather than mating opportunities, may be a key selection pressure in females of socially monogamous species. Moreover, such pre-existing resource competition-selected traits (armaments) may become the object of mating preferences (ornaments); however, the benefits that males may gain in choosing more ornamented females remain unclear. Here, using observational data on free-living female great tits (\emph{Parus major}), we explore whether tie size, a well-known melanin-pigmented plumage trait, covaries with intrasexual aggressiveness during the breeding season and the investment in current reproduction (fledgling number and mass). We found consistent individual differences (i.e. personality variation) in most of the aggressiveness parameters studied. Moreover, we found support for a signalling role of tie size with respects to how close females approached intruders. Interestingly, this relationship was only evident in older females, not first-year breeding females, suggesting age-related changes in the information content of tie size in the context of same-sex aggressiveness. Additionally, although first-year breeding females, on average, produced fledglings with lower body mass compared to older females, tie size was positively associated with fledgling mass, suggesting that males could potentially gain benefits by choosing females with larger tie size. Experimental studies are now necessary to confirm whether females with larger tie size have a selective advantage in female competition (i.e. armament), as well as whether males base their mate choice on female tie size (i.e. ornament).}

These regularities could reflect motor constraints on pitch production or could reflect the melodic characteristics of speech. To distinguish between these possibilities we compared pitch patterns in instrumental musical themes, sentences, and birdsongs. Patterns due to production-related constraints should be common to all three domains, whereas patterns due to statistical learning from speech should be present in speech but not birdsong. Sequences were taken from English and French instrumental classical music, sentences from 4 languages, and songs of 56 songbird families. For sentences and birdsongs each syllable/note was assigned one pitch. For each sequence, we quantified patterns of post-skip reversals, the direction of the initial and final interval, the relative duration of the final syllable/note, and the pitch contour shape. Post-skip reversals predominated in all domains, likely reflecting a shared constraint: skips frequently take melodies toward the edges of the pitch range, forcing a subsequent reversal (as suggested by Von Hippel \& Huron, 2000). Arch-like contours and final lengthening were found in music and speech but not birdsong, possibly reflecting an influence of speech patterns on musical structure.},

Speciation rates in oscine passerines are so high, due to cultural evolution, that this bird lineage makes up half of the extant bird species. Leaf warblers are a speciose Old-World passerine family of limited morphological differentiation, so that songs are even more important for species delimitation. We took 16 sonographic traits from song recordings of 80 leaf warbler taxa and correlated them with 15 potentially explanatory variables, pairwise, and in linear models. Based on a well-resolved molecular phylogeny of the same taxa, all pairwise correlations were corrected for relatedness with phylogenetically independent contrasts and phylogenetic generalized linear models were used. We found a phylogenetic signal for most song traits, but a strong one only for the duration of the longest and of the shortest element, which are presumably inherited instead of learned. Body size of a leaf warbler species is a constraint on song frequencies independent of phylogeny. At least in this study, habitat density had only marginal impact on song features, which even disappeared through phylogenetic correction. Maybe most leaf warblers avoid the deterioration through sound propagation in dense vegetation by singing from exposed perches. Latitudinal (and longitudinal) extension of the breeding ranges was correlated with most song features, especially verse duration (longer polewards and westwards) and complexity (lower polewards). Climate niche or expansion history might explain these correlations. The number of different element types per verse decreases with elevation, possibly due to fewer resources and congeneric species at higher elevations.},

The text continued, and after various delays, memory was tested with a repetition of the target (old verbatim; O), a paraphrased lure (P), or a lure in which the meaning was changed. For prose, memory for surface details (as measured by O/P discrimination) declined over time (Experiments 2-4), as was expected. For poetry, memory for surface details (O/P discrimination) did not decline with increasing delay (Experiments 1, 3, and 4). This lack of decline in memory for the surface details of poetry is discussed in relation to similar results previously observed for musical excerpts (Dowling, Tillmann, \& Ayers, 2001), suggesting that a particular role is played by the temporal organization and rhythmic structure of poetry andmusic.},

It has also been proposed that social selection - i.e., selection exerted by social competition - may drive convergent evolution in signals mediating interspecific communication, yet this idea remains controversial. Here, we use color spectrophotometry, acoustic analyses, and playback experiments to assess the hypothesis of adaptive signal convergence in two competing nonsister taxa, Hypocnemis peruviana and H. subflava (Aves: Thamnophilidae). We show that the structure of territorial songs in males overlaps in sympatry, with some evidence of convergent character displacement. Conversely, nonterritorial vocal and visual signals in males are strikingly diagnostic, in line with 6.8\% divergence in mtDNA sequences. The same pattern of variation applies to females. Finally, we show that songs in both sexes elicit strong territorial responses within and between species, whereas songs of a third, allopatric and more closely related species (H. striata) are structurally divergent and elicit weaker responses. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence that social selection can act across species boundaries to drive convergent or parallel evolution in taxa competing for space and resources. \textcopyright{} 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

  abstract = {Visual signals are shaped by variation in the signaling environment through a process termed sensory drive, sometimes leading to speciation. However, the evidence for sensory drive in acoustic signals is restricted to comparisons between highly dissimilar habitats, or single-species studies in which it is difficult to rule out the influence of undetected ecological variables, pleiotropic effects, or chance. Here we assess whether this form of sensory drive-often termed " acoustic adaptation" -can generate signal divergence across ecological gradients. By studying avian communities in two Amazonian forest types, we show that songs of 17 " bamboo-specialist" bird species differ in predictable ways from their nearest relatives in adjacent terra firme forest. We also demonstrate that the direction of song divergence is correlated with the sound transmission properties of habitats, rather than with genetic divergence, ambient noise, or pleiotropic effects of mass and bill size. Our findings indicate that acoustic adaptation adds significantly to stochastic processes underlying song divergence, even when comparing between habitats with relatively similar structure. Furthermore, given that song differences potentially contribute to reproductive isolation, these findings are consistent with a wider role for sensory drive in the diversification of lineages with acoustic mating signals. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Interactions between species can promote evolutionary divergence of ecological traits and social signals, a process widely assumed to generate species differences in adaptive radiation. However, an alternative view is that lineages typically interact when relatively old, by which time selection for divergence is weak and potentially exceeded by convergent selection acting on traits mediating interspecific competition. Few studies have tested these contrasting predictions across large radiations, or by controlling for evolutionary time. Thus the role of species interactions in driving broad-scale patterns of trait divergence is unclear. Here we use phylogenetic estimates of divergence times to show that increased trait differences among coexisting lineages of ovenbirds (Furnariidae) are explained by their greater evolutionary age in relation to non-interacting lineages, and that-when these temporal biases are accounted for-the only significant effect of coexistence is convergence in a social signal (song). Our results conflict with the conventional view that coexistence promotes trait divergence among co-occurring organisms at macroevolutionary scales, and instead provide evidence that species interactions can drive phenotypic convergence across entire radiations, a pattern generally concealed by biases in age. \textcopyright{} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of a real-time ("open-end") version of the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm for the recognition of motor exercises. Given a possibly incomplete input stream of data and a reference time series, the open-end DTW algorithm computes both the size of the prefix of reference which is best matched by the input, and the dissimilarity between the matched portions. The algorithm was used to provide real-time feedback to neurological patients undergoing motor rehabilitation. Methods and materials: We acquired a dataset of multivariate time series from a sensorized long-sleeve shirt which contains 29 strain sensors distributed on the upper limb. Seven typical rehabilitation exercises were recorded in several variations, both correctly and incorrectly executed, and at various speeds, totaling a data set of 840 time series. Nearest-neighbour classifiers were built according to the outputs of open-end DTW alignments and their global counterparts on exercise pairs. The classifiers were also tested on well-known public datasets from heterogeneous domains. Results: Nonparametric tests show that (1) on full time series the two algorithms achieve the same classification accuracy (p-value = 0.32); (2) on partial time series, classifiers based on open-end DTW have a far higher accuracy ({$\kappa$} = 0.898 versus {$\kappa$} = 0.447 ; p {$<$} 1 0- 5); and (3) the prediction of the matched fraction follows closely the ground truth (root mean square {$<$} 10 \%). The results hold for the motor rehabilitation and the other datasets tested, as well. Conclusions: The open-end variant of the DTW algorithm is suitable for the classification of truncated quantitative time series, even in the presence of noise. Early recognition and accurate class prediction can be achieved, provided that enough variance is available over the time span of the reference. Therefore, the proposed technique expands the use of DTW to a wider range of applications, such as real-time biofeedback systems. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we bridge this gap by proposing a method that allows to measure such patterns in acoustic signals of arbitrary origin, without needs to have access to the language corpus underneath. The method has been applied to sixteen different human languages, recovering successfully some well-known laws of human communication at timescales even below the phoneme and finding yet another link between complexity and criticality in a biological system.

Challenging tasks elicit greater conformity amongst individuals, with rates of copying increasing with group size, leading to high probabilities of maladaptive herding amongst large groups confronted with uncertainty. Conversely, the reduced social learning of small groups, and the greater probability that social information would be accurate for less-challenging tasks, generated 'wisdom of the crowd' effects in other circumstances. Our model-based approach provides novel evidence that the likelihood of swarm intelligence versus herding can be predicted, resolving a longstanding puzzle in the literature.},

This paper reviews empirical and theoretical work on human symmetry perception with a focus on recent issues such as its neural underpinnings. Symmetry detection is shown to be a versatile, ongoing visual process that interacts with other visual processes. Evidence seems to converge towards the idea that symmetry detection is subserved by a preprocessing stage involving spatial filters followed by information integration across the visual field in higher-tier cortical areas.},

Attentional influences have now been demonstrated throughout visual cortex, and their influence on the processing of visual information is profound. Neuronal responses to attended locations or stimulus features are enhanced, whereas those from unattended locations or features are suppressed. This influence of attention increases as one ascends the hierarchy of visual areas in primate cortex, ultimately resulting in a neural representation of the visual world that is dominated by the behavioral relevance of the information, rather than designed to provide an accurate and complete description of it. This realization has led to a rethinking of the role of areas that have previously been considered to be 'purely sensory'.},

The occurrence of female copulatory orgasm appears to be highly variable, however, and its proximate causation is poorly understood. We investigated the proximate mechanisms that control orgasmic response in female macaques. During 238h of observation of sexual behaviour in a large captive group of Japanese macaques,Macaca fuscata, 240 copulations were recorded involving 68 different heterosexual pairs formed by 16 males and 26 females. Female orgasmic responses were observed in 80 of 240 copulations (33\%). The frequency of orgasms was not correlated with female age or dominance rank, but it was higher for copulations lasting longer and involving a higher number of mounts and pelvic thrusts. When the level of physical stimulation experienced by females during copulation was statistically controlled, the highest frequency of female orgasms was found among pairs formed by high-ranking males and low-ranking females and the lowest frequency among pairs formed by low-ranking males and high-ranking females. These findings suggest that the proximate mechanisms that control orgasmic threshold in female macaques are more responsive to social stimuli and less constrained by physiological limitations than previously thought.},

In pursuing this mystery, Elisabeth Lloyd arrives at another: How could anything as inadequate as the evolutionary explanations of the female orgasm have passed muster as science? A judicious and revealing look at all twenty-one evolutionary accounts of the trait of human female orgasm, Lloyd's book is at the same time a case study of how certain biases steer science astray." "Over the past fifteen years, the effect of sexist or male-centered approaches to science has been hotly debated. drawing especially on data from nonhuman primates and human sexology spanning eighty years, Lloyd shows what damage such bias does in the study of female orgasm. She also exposes a second pernicious form of bias that permeates the literature on female orgasms: a bias toward adaptationism. Here Lloyd's critique comes alive, demonstrating how most of the evolutionary accounts either are in conflict with, or lack, certain types of evidence necessary to make their cases - how they simply assume that female orgasm must exist because it helped females in the past reproduce. As she weighs the evidence, Lloyd takes on nearly everyone who has written on the subject: evolutionists, animal behaviorists, and feminists alike. Her clearly and cogently written book is at once a convincing case study of bias in science and a sweeping summary and analysis of what is known about the evolution of the intriguing trait of female orgasm."--BOOK JACKET},

Receivers vary in the extent to which they agree on the category membership of senders and this variation is a key parameter that may explain the diverse evolutionary pressures shaping recognition systems. High receiver agreement (e.g., sex recognition) should favor uniformity in signals and innate recognition templates in receivers, while low receiver agreement (e.g., neighbor recognition) should tend to favor diversity in signals and flexible learning in receivers. Further, variation in how specifically receivers categorize senders may constrain the evolution of signals that need to function for multiple audiences. It remains an open question how receivers integrate multiple signals of different types of social categories. By framing recognition systems in a population context we hope this perspective will help spur new efforts to model and empirically investigate the mechanisms underlying the diversity of recognition systems across animals.}

  abstract = {Estimating divergence times on phylogenies is critical in paleontological and neontological studies. Chronostratigraphically-constrained fossils are the only direct evidence of absolute timing of species divergence. Strict temporal calibration of fossil-only phylogenies provides minimum divergence estimates, and various methods have been proposed to estimate divergences beyond these minimum values. We explore the utility of simultaneous estimation of tree topology and divergence times using BEAST tip-dating on datasets consisting only of fossils by using relaxed morphological clocks and birth-death tree priors that include serial sampling (BDSS) at a constant rate through time. We compare BEAST results to those from the traditional maximum parsimony (MP) and undated Bayesian inference (BI) methods. Three overlapping datasets were used that span 250 million years of archosauromorph evolution leading to crocodylians. The first dataset focuses on early Sauria (31 taxa, 240 chars.), the second on early Archosauria (76 taxa, 400 chars.) and the third on Crocodyliformes (101 taxa, 340 chars.). For each dataset three time-calibrated trees (timetrees) were calculated: a minimum-age timetree with node ages based on earliest occurrences in the fossil record; a `smoothed' timetree using a range of time added to the root that is then averaged over zero-length internodes; and a tip-dated timetree. Comparisons within datasets show that the smoothed and tip-dated timetrees provide similar estimates. Only near the root node do BEAST estimates fall outside the smoothed timetree range. The BEAST model is not able to overcome limited sampling to correctly estimate divergences considerably older than sampled fossil occurrence dates. Conversely, the smoothed timetrees consistently provide node-ages far older than the strict dates or BEAST estimates for morphologically conservative sister-taxa when they sit on long ghost lineages. In this latter case, the relaxed-clock model appears to be correctly moderating the node-age estimate based on the limited morphological divergence. Topologies are generally similar across analyses, but BEAST trees for crocodyliforms differ when clades are deeply nested but contain very old taxa. It appears that the constant-rate sampling assumption of the BDSS tree prior influences topology inference by disfavoring long, unsampled branches.},

The question thus arises: why were salmon not used and stored en masse much earlier?

Although extensively studied, the pathophysiology, i.e. the link between the extra X and the phenotype, largely remains unexplained. The scope of this review is to summarize the progress made in recent years on the role of the supernumerary X chromosome with respect to its putative influence on the phenotype. In principal, the parental origin of the X chromosome, gene-dosage effects in conjunction with (possibly skewed) X chromosome inactivation, and--especially concerning spermatogenesis--meiotic failure may play pivotal roles. One of the X chromosomes is inactivated to achieve dosage-compensation in females and probably likewise in KS. Genes from the pseudoautosomal regions and an additional 15\% of other genes, however, escape X inactivation and are candidates for putatively constituting the KS phenotype. Examples are the SHOX genes, identified as likely causing the tall stature regularly seen in KS. Lessons learned from comparisons with normal males and especially females as well as other sex chromosomal aneuploidies are presented. In addition, genetic topics concerning fertility and counseling are discussed.},

  abstract = {Humans and songbirds learn to sing or speak by listening to acoustic models, forming auditory templates, and then learning to produce vocalizations that match the templates. These taxa have evolved specialized telencephalic pathways to accomplish this complex form of vocal learning, which has been reported for very few other taxa. By contrast, the acoustic structure of most animal vocalizations is produced by species-specific vocal motor programmes in the brainstem that do not require auditory feedback. However, many mammals and birds can learn to fine-tune the acoustic features of inherited vocal motor patterns based upon listening to conspecifics or noise. These limited forms of vocal learning range from rapid alteration based on real-time auditory feedback to long-term changes of vocal repertoire and they may involve different mechanisms than complex vocal learning. Limited vocal learning can involve the brainstem, mid-brain and/or telencephalic networks. Understanding complex vocal learning, which underpins human speech, requires careful analysis of which species are capable of which forms of vocal learning. Selecting multiple animal models for comparing the neural pathways that generate these different forms of learning will provide a richer view of the evolution of complex vocal learning and the neural mechanisms that make it possible.}

However, they did not become more discriminable over time between or within the two archeological sites. Our observations provide support for an account of the Blombos and Diepkloof engravings as decorations and as socially transmitted cultural traditions.

We report on a bilateral visual region of occipital cortex that responds strongly to the presence of multiple symmetries in the viewed image. The stimuli consisted of random dots organized in fourfold and onefold mirror-symmetric patterns, against random control stimuli. The contrast between symmetric and random patterns produced negligible or inconsistent activation of the primary visual projection area V1 or of other medial occipital projection areas. However, there was strong symmetry-specific activation in extra-retinotopic lateral occipital cortex. The high level of activation in this region of cortex may represent part of a general class of computations that require integration of information across a large span of the visual field. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

However, processing the avalanche of audio recordings remains challenging, and represents nowadays a major bottleneck that slows down its application in research and conservation. We present scikit-maad, an open-source Python package dedicated to the analysis of environmental audio recordings. This package was designed to (a) load and process digital audio, (b) segment and find regions of interest, (c) compute acoustic features and (d) estimate sound pressure levels. The package also provides field recordings and a comprehensive online documentation that includes practical examples with step-by-step instructions for beginners and advanced users. scikit-maad opens the possibility to efficiently scan large audio datasets and easily integrate additional machine learning Python packages into the analysis, allowing to measure acoustic properties and identify key patterns in all kinds of soundscapes. To support reproducible research, the package is released under the BSD open-source licence, which allows unrestricted redistribution for commercial and private use. This development will create synergies between the community of ecoacousticians, such as engineers, data scientists, ecologists, biologists and conservation practitioners, to explore and understand the processes underlying the acoustic diversity of ecological systems.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}For male songbirds, song rate varies throughout the breeding season and is correlated with breeding cycle stages. Although these patterns have been well documented, this relationship has not been used to predict a bird's breeding status from acoustic monitoring. This challenge of using a response (i.e., behavior) to indirectly measure an underlying biological state is common in ecology, but correctly addressing the associated statistical challenge of calibration is rare. The objective of this study was to determine whether variation in song rate can be used to predict the breeding status of the Olive-sided Flycatcher (\emph{Contopus cooperi}). In 2016, song rates from 28 male Olive-sided Flycatchers were collected from human observers (\emph{n}~=~545 five-minute counts) and breeding status (i.e., single, paired, and feeding young) was monitored throughout the breeding season. The predictive ability of three modeling approaches\textemdash regression, hierarchical, and a classification tree\textemdash was evaluated using sensitivity and specificity to determine the best modeling approach. The hierarchical model was the best at predicting all three breeding status classes, with a mean sensitivity of 69\%, compared with 54\% and 50\% from the regression and machine learning models, respectively. Our results suggest that song rate can be used as an indirect measurement of breeding status in the Olive-sided Flycatcher when using a hierarchical modeling approach to calibrate the breeding status\textendash song rate relationship. This novel modeling approach provides a cost-effective tool to collect much needed demographic information over large spatial extents and inform species status assessments, recovery strategies, and management plans for species of conservation concern.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Michel Foucault described self-policing as the modern replacement for external, authoritarian methods of surveillance \& social regulation. Today, discipline is instilled within, \& punishment, if we waver from the norm, self-induced. This paper identifies self-policing practices in relation to the experience \& construction of 'premenstrual syndrome' (PMS). Drawing on in-depth interviews with 36 British \& 34 Australian women, it is argued that women's experience of distress or anger premenstrually, their positioning of this experience as pathology, \& their self-positioning as a 'PMS sufferer' are connected to the self-policing practices of self-silencing, self-surveillance, overresponsibility, self-blame, \& self-sacrifice. This is closely associated with hegemonic constructions of idealized femininity: the positioning of women as emotional nurturers of others, necessitating self-renunciation; the juxtaposition of the 'good' \& 'bad' woman; \& the positioning of woman as closer to nature, with subjectivity tied to the body. Premenstrually, a rupture in self-silencing occurs, yet this is followed by increased self-surveillance, leading to guilt, shame, \& blaming of the body. Identifying self-policing practices allows women to develop more empowering strategies for reducing or preventing premenstrual distress, developing an ethic of care for the self \& no longer blaming the body for premenstrual anger or depression. 60 References.

This paper examines ways in which zvomen experience and negotiate premenstrual change in affect, positioned as premenstrual syndrome (PMS), drawing on in-depth inter-views conducted with fifiy-nine women. All of the women interviewed described premenstrual changes in affect in a similar manner, as being characterised by intolerance, irritation, emotional sensitivity, feeling more negative towards others, and feeling overwhelmed in the face of life's derrtartds. Without exception, women expressed a desire to be alone premenstrually, in order to escape relational demands and responsibilities, to reduce stimulation, or to avoid conflict. The way that these premenstrual changes and the woman's desire to be alone were positioned by the woman's partner, and dealt with within relationships, provided the material and discursive context for the woman's experience and negotiation of PMS. Women whose partners were accepting and supportive were more likely to take up a position of awareness, acceptance and self-care in relation to premenstrual change, whilst women whose partners were unsupportive were more likely to engage in self-castigation and self-pathologisation. This suggests that intersubjectivity, the examination of subjectivity and affect in 144 critical psychology the context of relatedness, will be a fruitful avenue of exploration for critical psychologists, as well as for researchers interested in the complexity of women's premenstrual experiences.},

This qualitative study examines whether is it possible for women in a Western cultural context to negotiate negative premenstrual change in order to effectively avoid or reduce premenstrual distress. Sixty women who self-defined as a 'PMS sufferer' took part in one-to-one interviews, which were analysed using theoretical thematic analysis from a material-discursive-intrapsychic (MDI) perspective. Three major themes were consistently identified across relationship type and context, reflecting women's strategies of premenstrual self-regulation and coping: 'Self-monitoring and awareness: recognition and acceptance of premenstrual change'; 'Coping through self-regulation of premenstrual distress', including: 'avoidance of stress and conflict', 'escaping relational demands and responsibilities', and 'care of the self'; and 'Coping as an inter-subjective experience'. These findings challenge the view of PMS as a fixed unitary syndrome, suggesting that premenstrual change is an ongoing process of negotiation, in which women are agentic subjects, not passive 'PMS sufferers'. This has implications for therapists working with women reporting moderate-severe PMS, suggesting that the reframing of 'symptoms' as normal change, behavioural coping strategies, and self-monitoring, can effectively reduce premenstrual distress.},

Judith and her male partner pathologised premenstrual change, constructing the premenstrual self as out of control, and the epitome of the `monstrous feminine'. Judith reported feeling over-burdened and uncontrollably angry premenstrually, associated with relationship issues and absence of partner recognition or support. In contrast, Sophia normalised premenstrual change, challenging the association between PMS and the construction of woman as deviant or dysfunctional. Sophia reported heightened energy and creativity premenstrually, and engaged in self-care supported by her woman partner. These cases demonstrate that premenstrual distress is an intersubjective experience, with constructions and material practices within relationships providing the context for premenstrual women being positioned as pathological and needing to be contained, or conversely, as sensitive and needing support.

  abstract = {Although the genetic and ecological effects of population declines in endangered species have been well studied, little is known of the social consequences. Changes in signaling behavior may result in disrupted communication and affect both reproductive and conflict-resolution activities. The North Island K\=okako (Callaeas wilsoni) is an endangered, duetting (i.e., alternating, coordinated singing by mated pairs) songbird endemic to New Zealand temperate rain forests. Scattered populations (approximately 1500 individuals in 13 surviving and 11 translocated populations) in isolated conservation areas of different sizes have been rescued from extirpation and are currently recovering. We examined key song attributes of the K\=okako to assess whether population size or growth rate are related to song complexity, the reduction of which may compromise effective communication. We analyzed song repertoire size and phrase-type sharing (i.e., Jaccard index of similarity), vocal performance (singing rates, song switching rates, and diversity of phrase types), and song syntactical characteristics (i.e., unpredictability in sequences of phrase types) in surviving and translocated populations (populations of approximately 19\textendash 250 territorial individuals). Population size was positively correlated with a population's song repertoire, song diversity, and switching of song phrase types and negatively correlated with shared phrase types and variation in syntactical structure of songs. Population growth rate correlated positively with pair repertoire size, population repertoire size, and singing rates during song bouts. As for solo-singing species in fragmented landscapes, songs in the fragmented populations of K\=okako appear to be undergoing microevolution as occurs in island colonization events. Our results suggest that vocal changes in small populations could affect population establishment and growth, particularly in multiple-source translocations. We believe measurement of vocal behavior could be used as a supplement to periodic population censuses to allow more frequent monitoring of population size.

  abstract = {Geographical variation of birdsong is used to study various topics from cultural evolution to mechanisms responsible for reproductive barriers or song acquisition. In species with pronounced dialects, however, patterns of variation in non-dialect parts of the song are usually overlooked. We focused on the individually variable initial phrase of the song of the Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), a common Palearctic passerine which became a model species for dialect research. We used a quantitative method to compare the similarity of initial phrases from the repertoires of 237 males recorded at different spatial scales in a central European country covering all main dialect types. We hypothesized that patterns of initial phrase sharing and/or phrase similarity are affected by dialect boundaries and geographical proximity (i.e. that birds from the same dialect regions use more similar phrases or share them more often). Contrary to our expectations, initial phrase variation seems unrelated to dialects, as we did not find higher similarity either among recordings from the same dialect areas or among those from the same locality. Interestingly, despite the immense variability of phrase types detected (only 16\% of 368 detected initial phrase types were shared between at least 2 males), a relatively high proportion of males (45\%) was involved in sharing, and males using the same initial phrase were located anywhere from tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers apart. The patterns of variation suggest that precise copying during song learning as well as improvisation play important roles in forming individual repertoires in the Yellowhammer. Our data also confirm previous indications that the repertoires of Yellowhammer males (i.e. the composition of initial phrases) are individually unique and temporally stable. This makes the species a good candidate for individual acoustic monitoring, useful for detailed population or behavioral studies without the need for physical capture and marking of males.},

Although models for binary data are infamous for their computational intractability, we present a computationally efficient model for estimating network structures. The approach, which is based on Ising models as used in physics, combines logistic regression with model selection based on a Goodness-of-Fit measure to identify relevant relationships between variables that define connections in a network. A validation study shows that this method succeeds in revealing the most relevant features of a network for realistic sample sizes. We apply our proposed method to estimate the network of depression and anxiety symptoms from symptom scores of 1108 subjects. Possible extensions of the model are discussed.},

Using a go/no go paradigm we show that zebra finches are able to distinguish between an isochronous and an irregular stimulus. However, when the tempo of the isochronous stimulus is changed, it is no longer treated as similar to the training stimulus. Training with three isochronous and three irregular stimuli did not result in improvement of the generalization. In contrast, humans, exposed to the same stimuli, readily generalized across tempo changes. Our results suggest that zebra finches distinguish the different stimuli by learning specific local temporal features of each individual stimulus rather than attending to the global structure of the stimuli, i.e., to the temporal regularity.},

  abstract = {Human behaviour is often based on social learning, a mechanism that has been documented also in a variety of other vertebrates. However, social learning as a means of problem-solving may be optimal only under specific conditions, and both theoretical work and laboratory experiments highlight the importance of a potential model's identity. Here we present the results from a social learning experiment on six wild vervet monkey groups, where models were either a dominant female or a dominant male. We presented 'artificial fruit' boxes that had doors on opposite, differently coloured ends for access to food. One option was blocked during the demonstration phase, creating consistent demonstrations of one possible solution. Following demonstrations we found a significantly higher participation rate and same-door manipulation in groups with female models compared to groups with male models. These differences appeared to be owing to selective attention of bystanders to female model behaviour rather than owing to female tolerance. Our results demonstrate the favoured role of dominant females as a source for 'directed' social learning in a species with female philopatry. Our findings imply that migration does not necessarily lead to an exchange of socially acquired information within populations, potentially causing highly localized traditions. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Royal Society.},

The action of T within specific brain regions involved in the regulation of song may occur either directly, or through its androgenic or estrogenic metabolites. In the present study, we tested steroid-dependence of great tit dawn song by blocking both known pathways of T action by simultaneous implantation of flutamide, an anti-androgen, and ATD, an aromatase inhibitor. By our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the effects of androgen inhibitors on dawn song in free-living birds. Male great tits were implanted during their mate's egg laying stage, being the time of maximal male song activity at dawn. Treatment with ATD and flutamide significantly increased plasma T levels, probably because feedback mechanisms on T secretion were inhibited. The treatment decreased the likelihood of showing dawn song, which is in line with the hypothesis that sex steroids are involved in the endocrine control of song behavior. In males that did show dawn song, we found no evidence for a treatment effect on song quality. Although the implants were present for the larger part of the breeding season, males were able to maintain control of a territory and mate and to complete their brood cycle as successful as control males.},

The great number of perforated red deer canines and the preference for teeth from young stags contrast with the virtual absence of red deer in southwestern French faunal assemblages dated to the same period as the burial. The rarity and probable exotic origin of these teeth, the small number of paired canines, and the technological and morphological homogeneity of the collection suggest that the teeth were obtained through long-distance trade and represented prestige items. As observed in a number of hunter\textendash gatherer populations and contrary to the supposed egalitarian character of Upper Palaeolithic societies, these items may have materialized the integration of this individual into a privileged social group. Results suggest that application of the integrated approach followed in this study to the remainder of Upper Palaeolithic burials may be useful in identifying other societies in which prestige items represented the tangible expression of social inequality.},

However, possible direct effects of the sex chromosomes, that is, XX or XY, have not been well studied in humans. Individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a 46,XY karyotype but a female phenotype due to a complete androgen resistance, enable us to study the separate effects of gonadal hormones versus sex chromosomes on neural sex differences. Therefore, in the present study, we compared 46,XY men (n = 30) and 46,XX women (n = 29) to 46,XY individuals with CAIS (n = 21) on a mental rotation task using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Previously reported sex differences in neural activation during mental rotation were replicated in the control groups, with control men showing more activation in the inferior parietal lobe than control women. Individuals with CAIS showed a female-like neural activation pattern in the parietal lobe, indicating feminization of the brain in CAIS. Furthermore, this first neuroimaging study in individuals with CAIS provides evidence that sex differences in regional brain function during mental rotation are most likely not directly driven by genetic sex, but rather reflect gonadal hormone exposure.},

Relationships between `personality traits' and fitness imply that personality traits can evolve by means of natural selection. We studied whether animal personality is also involved in sexual selection. We investigated whether exploratory behaviour (an aspect of animal personality, ranging from `slow' to `fast') correlated with the occurrence of extrapair paternity (EPP) in broods of wild great tits. We expected that EPP rates should be highest for females mated with social partners of the same personality type (i.e. for slow\textendash slow or fast\textendash fast pairs, but not other pair combinations). We found that the likelihood of EPP was highest for these pairs. Disassortative extrapair mating with respect to personality can be the consequence of several non-mutually exclusive processes. It might be caused by adaptive mate choice, which allows assortatively paired females to produce offspring with either more variable or more intermediate phenotypes, but it could also be the consequence of behavioural incompatibility between extreme behavioural phenotypes. Our findings indicate that personality differences play a role in the mechanism behind extrapair behaviours and we therefore conclude that it is now plausible that partner preference is based not only on morphological characteristics, but also on consistent behavioural traits or personality.},

But only humans show strong evidence of complex, cumulative culture, which is the product ofcopying and the resulting effect ofcumulative cultural evolution. The reasons for this increase in complexity have recently become the subject ofextensive debate. Here, we examine these reasons, relying on both comparative and paleoarcheological data. The currently best-supported inference is that culture began to be truly cumulative (and so, outside the primate range) around 500,000 years ago. We suggest that the best explanation for its onset is the emergence of verbal teaching, which not only requires language and thus probably coevolved with the latter's evolution but also reflects the overall increase in proactive cooperation due to extensive allomaternal care. A subsequent steep increase in cumulative culture, roughly 75 ka, may reflect the rise ofactive novelty seeking (curiosity), which led to a dramatic range expansion and steep increase in the diversity and complexity of material culture. A final, and continuing, period of acceleration began with the Neolithic (agricultural) revolution.},

In total, 8505 syllables were classified into 296 syllable types. All males shared syllables but most types were unique to particular males, suggesting that males invent most of their repertoires. Repertoire dissimilarity increased with geographic distance. Within sites, syllable sharing was higher between intermediate than between adjacent neighbours. These results suggest that juvenile dispersal distance is {$<$}2.5 km and relatively lower song sharing between adjacent neighbours may result from non-random dispersal or active avoidance by open-ended learners.},

Our investigations of the same KE family indicate that the inherited disorder has a broad phenotype which transcends impaired generation of syntactical rules and includes a striking articulatory impairment as well as defects in intellectual, linguistic, and orofacial praxic functions generally. Although the evidence from this family thus provides no support for the existence of "grammar genes," their linguistic difficulties do constitute a prominent part of their phenotype.

Gender differences in human brain might be related to patterns of gene expression. Microarray technology is one useful method for investigation of gene expression in brain. We investigated gene expression, cell types, and regional expression patterns of differentially expressed sex chromosome genes in brain. We profiled gene expression in male and female dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum using the Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray platform. Differentially expressed genes between males and females on the Y chromosome (DBY, SMCY, UTY, RPS4Y, and USP9Y) and X chromosome (XIST) were confirmed using real-time PCR measurements. In situ hybridization confirmed the differential expression of gender-specific genes and neuronal expression of XIST, RPS4Y, SMCY, and UTY in three brain regions examined. The XIST gene, which silences gene expression on regions of the X chromosome, is expressed in a subset of neurons. Since a subset of neurons express gender-specific genes, neural subpopulations may exhibit a subtle sexual dimorphism at the level of differences in gene regulation and function. The distinctive pattern of neuronal expression of XIST, RPS4Y, SMCY, and UTY and other sex chromosome genes in neuronal subpopulations may possibly contribute to gender differences in prevalence noted for some neuropsychiatric disorders. Studies of the protein expression of these sex-chromosome-linked genes in brain tissue are required to address the functional consequences of the observed gene expression differences.},

Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

  abstract = {Seabirds must often travel vast distances to exploit heterogeneously distributed oceanic resources, but how routes and destinations of foraging trips are optimized remains poorly understood. Among the seabirds, gadfly petrels (Pterodroma spp.) are supremely adapted for making efficient use of wind energy in dynamic soaring flight. We used GPS tracking data to investigate the role of wind in the flight behaviour and foraging strategy of the Desertas petrel, Pterodroma deserta. We found that rather than visiting foraging hotspots, Desertas petrels maximize prey encounter by covering some of the longest distances known in any animal in a single foraging trip (up to 12 000 km) over deep, pelagic waters. Petrels flew with consistent crosswind (relative wind angle 60\textdegree ), close to that which maximizes their groundspeed. By combining state-space modelling with a series of comparisons to simulated foraging trips (reshuffled-random, rotated, time-shifted, reversed), we show that this resulted in trajectories that were close to the fastest possible, given the location and time. This wind use is thus consistent both with birds using current winds to fine-tune their routes and, impressively, with an a priori knowledge of predictable regional-scale wind regimes, facilitating efficient flight over great distances before returning to the home colony.},

There are two positions in the debate about the evolution of combinatorial structure: one stresses the importance of distinctiveness, while the other stresses economy and efficient reuse of building blocks. Different sources of evidence can be used to investigate the origins of combinatorial structure, such as emerging sign languages, animal communication systems, analysis of modern language and computer simulations but each source has its problems. In this article it is demonstrated that a novel empirical method from the field of language evolution can help to gain insight into the emergence of phonological combinatorial organization. This method, experimental iterated learning, allows investigating cultural evolution and the development of structure over time with human participants. We present data from an experiment in which combinatorial structure emerges in artificial whistled languages. We show that our experiment can give insight into the role of distinctiveness and reuse of building blocks and how they interact. We argue that experimental iterated learning offers a valuable new tool for investigating questions on evolutionary phonology and phonetics. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here we test whether statistical universals that have been identified for melodic structures in music can emerge as a result of cultural adaptation to human biases through iterated learning. We use data from an experiment in which artificial whistled systems, where sounds produced with a slide whistle were learned by human participants and transmitted multiple times from person to person. These sets of whistled signals needed to be memorised and recalled and the reproductions of one participant were used as the input set for the next. We tested for the emergence of seven different melodic features, such as discrete pitches, motivic patterns, or phrase repetition, and found some evidence for the presence of most of these statistical universals. We interpret this as promising evidence that, similarly to rhythmic universals, iterated learning experiments can also unearth melodic statistical universals. More, ideally cross-cultural, experiments are nonetheless needed. Simulating the cultural transmission of artificial proto-musical systems can help unravel the origins of universal tendencies in musical structures.},

  abstract = {The importance of dispersal for population genetics, population dynamics, and conservation biology is well established. We studied natal dispersal of Great Tits between Wytham Wood (high-quality habitat), and hedgerows and small woodlands within 2 km of Wytham Wood (the ``surrounding area''; low-quality habitat). We (1) quantified the exchange of birds between these habitats, and (2) evaluated whether there was phenotypic variation between dispersing and philopatric birds. Only 6\% of immigrants in Wytham were born in the surrounding area, and only 5\% of emigrant recruits from Wytham bred in the surrounding area. This indicates that most nonphilopatric birds dispersed {$>$}2 km, considerably farther than expected. The effect of sex on dispersal depends on the scale on which it is studied: females dispersed longer distances than males, but the exchange of birds between woodlands was not sex biased. The proportion of immigrants among breeding birds was similar for both sexes, confirming the latter result. Dispersing and philopatric birds did not differ in hatch date, but birds that hatched in the surrounding area and dispersed into Wytham had greater nestling mass than those that did not. This effect was not found in Wytham, suggesting that there is an interaction between phenotypic quality and habitat quality with respect to dispersal: birds of high phenotypic quality disperse when they are born in low-quality habitat. As a result, birds breeding in Wytham (high-quality) had greater mass as nestlings than birds breeding in the surrounding area (low-quality). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that conditions during early development have an affect on the quality of the environment in which a bird subsequently reproduces.},

  abstract = {Iconic representations (i.e., figurative imagery and realistic art) only started to appear consistently some 45,000 years ago, although humans have been anatomically modern since 200,000-160,000 years ago. What explains this? Some authors have suggested a neurocognitive change took place, leading to a creative explosion, although this has been contested. Here, we examine the hypothesis that demographic changes caused cultural "cumulative adaptive evolution" and as such the emergence of modern symbolic behavior. This approach usefully explains the evolution of utilitarian skills and tools, and the creation of symbols to identify groups. However, it does not equally effectively explain the evolution of behaviors that may not be directly adaptive, such as the production of iconic representations like figurines and rock art. In order to shed light on their emergence, we propose to combine the above-mentioned cultural hypothesis with the concept of sensory exploitation. The concept essentially states that behavioral traits (in this case iconic art production) which exploit pre-existing sensory sensitivities will evolve if not hindered by costs (i.e., natural selection). In this view, iconic art traditions are evolved by piggy-backing on cumulative adaptive evolution. Since it is to date uncertain whether art has served any adaptive function in human evolution, parsimony demands paying more attention to the primary and a functional mechanism of sensory exploitation as opposed to mechanisms of models based exclusively on secondary benefits (such as Miller's, for instance, in which art is proposed to evolve as a sexual display of fitness).},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Two major mechanisms of aesthetic evolution have been suggested. One focuses on naturally selected preferences (Evolutionary Aesthetics), while the other describes a process of evaluative coevolution whereby preferences coevolve with signals. Signaling theory suggests that expertise moderates these mechanisms. In this article we set out to verify this hypothesis in the domain of art and use it to elucidate Western modern art's deviation from naturally selected preferences. We argue that this deviation is consistent with a Coevolutionary Aesthetics mechanism driven by prestige-biased social learning among art experts. In order to test this hypothesis, we conducted two studies in which we assessed the effects on lay and expert appreciation of both the biological relevance of the given artwork's depicted content, viz., facial beauty, and the prestige specific to the artwork's associated context (MoMA). We found that laypeople appreciate artworks based on their depictions of facial beauty, mediated by aesthetic pleasure, which is consistent with previous studies. In contrast, experts appreciate the artworks based on the prestige of the associated context, mediated by admiration for the artist. Moreover, experts appreciate artworks depicting neutral faces to a greater degree than artworks depicting attractive faces. These findings thus corroborate our contention that expertise moderates the Evolutionary and Coevolutionary Aesthetics mechanisms in the art domain. Furthermore, our findings provide initial support for our proposal that prestige-driven coevolution with expert evaluations plays a decisive role in modern art's deviation from naturally selected preferences. After discussing the limitations of our research as well as the relation that our results bear on cultural evolution theory, we provide a number of suggestions for further research into the potential functions of expert appreciation that deviates from naturally selected preferences, on the one hand, and expertise as a moderator of these mechanisms in other cultural domains, on the other.},

The concept of culture began to be increasingly used in the context of animal behaviour research around the 1960s. Despite its success, it is not clear that it represents what philosophers have traditionally thought to be a natural kind. In this article I will show, however, how conceiving of animal culture in this fashion has played a role in the ``culture wars'', and what lessons we can draw from this. First, an analysis of the epistemological landscape of author keywords related to the concept of animal cultures is presented, thus vindicating the centrality of the concept in describing a broad range of findings. A minimal definition that encompasses the multiple strands of research incorporating the notion of culture is proposed. I then systematically enumerate the ways in which culture thus conceived cannot be considered a natural kind in the study of animal behaviour. This is accomplished by reviewing the efforts and possibilities of anchoring the elusive idea in specific mechanisms, homologies, selection pressures, homeostatic property clusters, or alternatively, its reduction or elimination. Finally, a plausible interpretation of the scientific status of the animal culture concept is suggested that is compatible with both its well established use in animal behaviour research and its inferential limitations. Culture plays the role of a well-established epistemic kind, a node that connects different areas of research on common themes.},

It aims to establish the extent to which the distinctive features of adult representatives of these populations are present in the early post natal period and to what extent population differences in ontogenetic scaling and allometric trajectories contribute to distinct facial forms. The analyses utilize configurations of facial landmarks and are carried out using geometric morphometric methods. The results of this study show that modern human populations can be distinguished based on facial shape alone, irrespective of age or sex, indicating the early presence of differences. Additionally, some populations have statistically distinct facial ontogenetic trajectories that lead to the development of further differences later in ontogeny. We conclude that population-specific facial morphologies develop principally through distinctions in facial shape probably already present at birth and further accentuated and modified to variable degrees during growth. These findings raise interesting questions regarding the plasticity of facial growth patterns in modern humans. Further, they have important implications in relation to the study of growth in the face of fossil hominins and in relation to the possibility of developing effective discriminant functions for the identification of population affinities of immature facial skeletal material. Such tools would be of value in archaeological, forensic and anthropological applications. The findings of this study underline the need to examine more deeply, and in more detail, the ontogenetic basis of other causes of craniometric variation, such as sexual dimorphism and hominin species differentiation.},

XXY aneuploidy is the most common disorder of sex chromosomes in humans, with prevalence of one in 500 males. Other sex chromosomal aneuploidies have also been described, although they are much less frequent, with 48,XXYY and 48,XXXY being present in 1 per 17,000 to 1 per 50,000 male births. The incidence of 49,XXXXY is 1 per 85,000 to 100,000 male births. In addition, 46,XX males also exist and it is caused by translocation of Y material including sex determining region (SRY) to the X chromosome during paternal meiosis. Formal cytogenetic analysis is necessary to make a definite diagnosis, and more obvious differences in physical features tend to be associated with increasing numbers of sex chromosomes. If the diagnosis is not made prenatally, 47,XXY males may present with a variety of subtle clinical signs that are age-related. In infancy, males with 47,XXY may have chromosomal evaluations done for hypospadias, small phallus or cryptorchidism, developmental delay. The school-aged child may present with language delay, learning disabilities, or behavioral problems. The older child or adolescent may be discovered during an endocrine evaluation for delayed or incomplete pubertal development with eunuchoid body habitus, gynecomastia, and small testes. Adults are often evaluated for infertility or breast malignancy. Androgen replacement therapy should begin at puberty, around age 12 years, in increasing dosage sufficient to maintain age appropriate serum concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). The effects on physical and cognitive development increase with the number of extra Xs, and each extra X is associated with an intelligence quotient (IQ) decrease of approximately 15\textendash 16 points, with language most affected, particularly expressive language skills.},

  abstract = {Diaphragmatic defects and limb deficiencies usually occur as independent anomalies, as a polytopic field defect (in which ipsilateral anomalies might be expected) or as wider pattern of defects, potentially involving disturbance of laterality or the midline (in which bilateral or contralateral defects would occur). Data on cases from previous studies and/or the literature were used to determine whether there is an association between the sides involved in the defects. The 88 adequately described cases identified included 20 with de Lange syndrome, seven with Poland anomaly, four with trisomy 18, 52 with other patterns of multiple malformations and five with diaphragmatic and limb defects alone. Evaluation of the position of the limb (left, right, bilateral) and the diaphragmatic defects (left, right, bilateral) did not show significant association in patterns of sidedness (P = 0.48). In 56\% of cases, the limb deficiencies were bilateral. Among the 32 unilateral cases, 19 (59\%) were ipsilateral (15 left; 4 right) and 13(41\%) were contralateral (P = 0.38). Eleven of the 13 contralateral cases had left sided diaphragmatic defects and right sided limb deficiency; four had de Lange syndrome and nine had other patterns of multiple anomalies. Only cases with Poland anomaly or otherwise isolated defects showed a trend towards ipsilateral defects. Most cases with multiple congenital anomalies, had limbs defects on both the right and left (57\%) or both sides of the diaphragm were affected (an additional 10\%), indicating a widespread dysmorphogenetic process rather than a more restricted field defect. In other cases, defects were bilateral or, if unilateral, reflected the propensities for diaphragmatic defects to more often involve the left side, and limb defects, the right.},

Angular patterns of increasing complexity (differently defined in each study) were presented to Ss, who were college students ranging in age from 17-26 yr. The results of Study I are interpreted as supporting the predictions that (1) humans have optimal or preferred amounts of visual complexity, and (2) with exposure to visual complexity the preferred amount increases. Study II confirms the 1st prediction but is inconclusive in the case of the 2nd. Both studies support the broader theoretical view that humans are information-processing systems, but neither indicates possible mechanisms by which visual stimuli are processed. Further development of the notion that humans are information-processing systems will require explicit models that describe stimulus organization and storage.

Reported here is the finding that the extent of differentiation between us and them varies along latitude rather than longitude. In geographically isolated preindustrial societies, intergroup differentiation already peaked at the equator and tapered off towards the poles, while being negligibly related to longitude (observation study 1). Contemporary societies have evolved even stronger latitudinal gradients of intergroup differentiation (survey study 2 around 1970) and discrimination (mixed-method study 3 around 2010). The geography of contemporary differentiation and discrimination can be partially predicted by tropical climate stress (warm winters, hot summers and irregular rainfall), largely mediated by the interplay of pathogen stress and agricultural subsistence (explanatory study 4). The findings accumulate into an index of intergroup discrimination by inhabitants of 222 countries (integrative study 5).}

It is generally accepted that caste determination, including the differentiation of females into sterile workers and reproductive queens, is determined by environmental factors. In contrast, we find that in the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, an individual's genotype at a particular microsatellite locus predicts its caste. We propose that this microsatellite locus is in tight linkage disequilibrium with at least one locus that plays an important role in caste determination. We call this the caste locus. We hypothesize that the system of caste determination we observe segregates the population into two distinct genetic lineages, each of which has distinct alleles at the microsatellite locus and also has distinct alleles, we propose, at caste. Workers are the offspring of parents from different lineages, and are thus heterozygous at caste, whereas queens are the offspring of parents from the same lineage, and are, therefore, homozygous at caste. This mode of caste determination has important consequences for the evolution of multiple mating by females and for control of the sex ratio and reproductive allocation in social insect colonies.},

  abstract = {Recent studies comparing craniometric and neutral genetic affinity matrices have concluded that, on average, human cranial variation fits a model of neutral expectation. While human craniometric and genetic data fit a model of isolation by geographic distance, it is not yet clear whether this is due to geographically mediated gene flow or human dispersal events. Recently, human genetic data have been shown to fit an iterative founder effect model of dispersal with an African origin, in line with the out-of-Africa replacement model for modern human origins, and Manica et al. (Nature 448 (2007) 346-349) have demonstrated that human craniometric data also fit this model. However, in contrast with the neutral model of cranial evolution suggested by previous studies, Manica et al. (2007) made the a priori assumption that cranial form has been subject to climatically driven natural selection and therefore correct for climate prior to conducting their analyses. Here we employ a modified theoretical and methodological approach to test whether human cranial variability fits the iterative founder effect model. In contrast with Manica et al. (2007) we employ size-adjusted craniometric variables, since climatic factors such as temperature have been shown to correlate with aspects of cranial size. Despite these differences, we obtain similar results to those of Manica et al. (2007), with up to 26\% of global within-population craniometric variation being explained by geographic distance from sub-Saharan Africa. Comparative analyses using non-African origins do not yield significant results. The implications of these results are discussed in the light of the modern human origins debate.},

  abstract = {Homoiologies are homoplasies that are caused by nongenetic environmental factors. The homoiology hypothesis predicts that osseous regions subject to repeated biomechanical stress during growth should be more variable and, therefore, less reliable for the reconstruction of phylogeny compared with osseous regions relatively unaffected by stress. Previous studies based on the analysis of multiple primate species found that regions of the cranium subject to masticatory-induced stress were significantly more variable than non-masticatory regions, as predicted by the homoiology hypothesis. However, these studies also found that the masticatory regions were no less reliable for reconstructing primate phylogenetic relationships when subjected to parsimony analysis. It was suggested, therefore, that homoiology may be a more potent problem for the reconstruction of phylogeny at the intraspecific level rather than interspecific phylogenetics. This suggestion was tested here using matched molecular and craniometric data for 12 modern human populations. The results show that, as predicted by the homoiology hypothesis, regions of the human cranium related to mastication were more variable than non-masticatory regions. However, masticatory regions were no less reliable for inferring human population history. Therefore, the results match those found from the interspecific analysis of primate species and do not support the suggestion that homoiology is a greater problem for the analysis of intraspecific taxa. The results also suggest that within-taxon variability cannot be relied upon to predict the phylogenetic efficacy of morphometric characters. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The study of cranial variation has a long, and somewhat difficult, history within anthropology. Much of this difficulty is rooted in the historical use of craniometric data to justify essentialist typological racial classification schemes. In the post-war era of the "New Physical Anthropology" (sensu Washburn, 1951), anthropologists began to analyse human variation in an explicitly populationist and evolutionary philosophical and analytical framework. However, even within recent decades, substantially different approaches have been employed; some advocate a focus on the analysis of individual traits or clines, while others are explicitly adaptationist, with a focus on natural selection as the preeminent force of phenotypic diversification. In recent years, a series of studies have analysed craniometric data in an explicitly quantitative genetic framework, which emphasises the importance of neutral forces such as migration, gene flow and genetic drift in creating global patterns of phenotypic diversity. This approach has revealed that global patterns of cranial variation can largely be explained on the basis of neutral theory. Therefore, human cranial data can be productively employed as a proxy for neutral genetic data in archaeological contexts. Moreover, there is a growing recognition that regions of the cranium differ in the extent to which they fit a neutral model of microevolutionary expectation, allowing for a more detailed assessment of patterns of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity within the human skull. Taking an historical perspective, the current state of knowledge regarding patterns of cranial adaptation in response to climatic and dietary effects is reviewed. Further insights will be gained by better incorporating the study of cranial and postcranial variation, as well as understanding the impact of neutral versus non-neutral evolution in creating among-species diversity patterns in primates more generally. However, this will most effectively be achieved when comparative anatomy studies are situated within an explicitly quantitative genetic evolutionary framework.},

The alternative defines pitch proximity in terms of two more basic constraints\textemdash a constraint on tessitura (or pitch distribution) and a constraint on "mobility" (or freedom of motion). This new definition offers several advantages. Whereas the usual definition predicts only interval size, the new definition predicts interval direction as well. The usual definition predicts small intervals generally, whereas the new definition predicts context- sensitive variations in interval size. Finally, if the new definition is given the first few notes in a melody, it can assign a probability to each of the pitches that could occur next. In sum, the new definition offers a more precise and detailed description of melodic structure.},

Although this tendency is often attributed to listeners' expectations, it might arise more simply from constraints on melodic ranginess or tessitura. Skips tend toward the extremes of a melody's tessitura, and from those extremes a melody has little choice but to retreat by changing direction. Statistical analyses of vocal melodies from four different continents are consistent with this simple explanation. The results suggest that, in the sampled repertoires, patterns such as "gap-fill," "registral direction," and "registral return" (L. Meyer, 1956, 1973; E. Narmour, 1990) are mere side effects of constraints on melodic tessitura.},

But men generally describe a higher sexual enjoyment and overestimate their partners' enjoyment, especially with regard to female orgasm through intercourse.

Understanding factors influencing consumers' gazing behaviour in an eye-tracking test will contribute to a better organisation and a more valid application of the method. The aim of this work is to study how test design influences gazing behaviour and decision time of food consumers in an eye-tracking test. Three factors of the test design were investigated: (1) Number of images in one testing picture (two, three, four, five, and six images/picture); (2) content of question (tastiness, healthiness, price, convenience, and familiarity); and (3) type of evaluation (maximum choice, minimum choice, ranking, rating, and grouping). Two experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, performed with 100 participants, the influence of individual factors was studied. In the second experiment, performed with 64 participants, the joint effects (interactions) of the tested factors were investigated. The results showed that gazing behaviour and decision time are strongly influenced by the type of evaluation and the number of images, but not by the content of question. No joint effect of influencing factors (number of images and type of evaluation) was found. Findings are discussed in considering the relationship between eye-movements, cognitive goals, and tasks. This study highlights the importance of understanding factors influencing gazing behaviour and decision time in an eye-tracking test.}

  abstract = {Women report anorgasmia and other difficulties achieving orgasm. One approach to alleviating this problem is to teach women about the clitoris. This assumes that women lack information about the clitoris and that knowledge about the clitoris is correlated with orgasm. Using a non-random sample of 833 undergraduate students, our study investigates both assumptions. First, we test the amount of knowledge about the clitoris, the reported sources of this knowledge, and the correlation between citing a source and actual knowledge. Second, we measure the correlation between clitoral knowledge and orgasm in both masturbation and partnered sex. Among a sample of undergraduate students, the most frequently cited sources of clitoral knowledge (school and friends) were associated with the least amount of tested knowledge. The source most likely to correlate with clitoral knowledge (self-exploration) was among the most rarely cited. Despite this, respondents correctly answered, on average, three of the five clitoral knowledge measures. Knowledge correlated significantly with the frequency of women's orgasm in masturbation but not partnered sex. Our results are discussed in light of gender inequality and a social construction of sexuality, endorsed by both men and women, that privileges men's sexual pleasure over women's, such that orgasm for women is pleasing, but ultimately incidental.},

The duration and direction of gaze were measured to discern visual preferences. Females exhibited preferences for the red versions of male faces.

The review offers some of the same inaccurate arguments of previous reviews and adds some of Puts' own. Puts offers three criticisms of Lloyd's thesis: (1) orgasm was an adaptation at some time in the past, whereas Lloyd's argument only applies if orgasm is a current adaptation; (2) Lloyd doesn't really understand what constitutes an adaptation; and (3) orgasm is actually a current adaptation resulting from male sperm competition and aids fertilization by easing sperm entry into the uterus (the unfortunately named 'upsuck' hypothesis of female orgasm). On all three of these points, Puts is incorrect. The evidence on the occurrence of female orgasm strongly supports Lloyd's contention that none of the adaptive explanations are even moderately supported by good evidence. Lloyd's book deserves a more careful, thoughtful, and accurate critique than that offered by Puts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Central to Lloyd's argument that current data best support a byproduct explanation of female orgasm is the almost flat distribution of women experiencing orgasm during intercourse from 'never' to 'always.' An adaptive explanation would predict a skewed, not flat, distribution. My statement that 20\% or less of women reliably achieve orgasm without needing any direct clitoral stimulation comes from Lloyd. Puts' figure is simply incorrect given that 60\% of Fisher's sample 'more irregularly or not at all' had orgasm in intercourse and 5-6\% never had orgasm by any means. It is also incorrect to suggest that either Lloyd or Fisher presented a 65\% estimate as Puts claims. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, orgasm during intercourse occurs much less reliably and consistly for females than for males (Lloyd 2005). The significance of this marked sex difference in sexual function is unexplained and of importance to understanding the evolution of female orgasm. The recent revival of the byproduct account of female orgasm (Lloyd 2005), in which the trait is nonadaptive but collateral to selection on the male orgasm, has evoked much debate (Barash 2005; Judson 2005; Zuk 2006). The byproduct account contends that female orgasm arose as the result of shared embryological processes shaped by selection on the male capacity for orgasm thus implying no direct selection on the female form of the trait. The argument is analogous to the presence of male nipples which result from males and females sharing a common embryology and selection for functional nipples in females.},

  abstract = {In men and women sexual arousal culminates in orgasm, with female orgasm solely from sexual intercourse often regarded as a unique feature of human sexuality. However, orgasm from sexual intercourse occurs more reliably in men than in women, likely reflecting the different types of physical stimulation men and women require for orgasm. In men, orgasms are under strong selective pressure as orgasms are coupled with ejaculation and thus contribute to male reproductive success. By contrast, women's orgasms in intercourse are highly variable and are under little selective pressure as they are not a reproductive necessity. The proximal mechanisms producing variability in women's orgasms are little understood. In 1924 Marie Bonaparte proposed that a shorter distance between a woman's clitoris and her urethral meatus (CUMD) increased her likelihood of experiencing orgasm in intercourse. She based this on her published data that were never statistically analyzed. In 1940 Landis and colleagues published similar data suggesting the same relationship, but these data too were never fully analyzed. We analyzed raw data from these two studies and found that both demonstrate a strong inverse relationship between CUMD and orgasm during intercourse. Unresolved is whether this increased likelihood of orgasm with shorter CUMD reflects increased penile-clitoral contact during sexual intercourse or increased penile stimulation of internal aspects of the clitoris. CUMD likely reflects prenatal androgen exposure, with higher androgen levels producing larger distances. Thus these results suggest that women exposed to lower levels of prenatal androgens are more likely to experience orgasm during sexual intercourse. \textcopyright{} 2011.},

However, recent work on the basal monotreme mammals has completely changed our conception of how and when this change occurred. Platypus and echidna lack SRY, and the therian X and Y are represented by autosomes, implying that SRY evolved in therians after their divergence from monotremes only 166 MYA. Clues to the ancestral mechanism usurped by SRY in therians are provided by the monotremes, whose sex chromosomes are homologous to the ZW of birds. This suggests that the therian X and Y, and the SRY gene, evolved from an ancient bird-like sex chromosome system which predates the divergence of mammals and reptiles 310 MYA.},

The characteristics included verse length, presence of refrains, presence and location of poetics, the pattern and number of end rhymes, the metrical patterns, average number of syllables per word, the pattern of meaning and imagery in lines, the frequency of repeated lines both within and across ballads in the set, the musical scales used, and the agreement of metrical stresses and musical beats.

  doi = {10.1088/1367-2630/ab3dd0},
  abstract = {Our understanding of how diseases spread has greatly benefited from advances in network modeling. However, despite of its importance for disease contagion, the directionality of edges has rarely been taken into account. On the other hand, the introduction of the multilayer framework has made it possible to deal with more complex scenarios in epidemiology such as the interaction between different pathogens or multiple strains of the same disease. In this work, we study in depth the dynamics of disease spreading in directed multilayer networks. Using the generating function approach and numerical simulations of a stochastic susceptible-infected-susceptible model, we calculate the epidemic threshold of synthetic and real-world multilayer systems and show that it is mainly determined by the directionality of the links connecting different layers, regardless of the degree distribution chosen for the layers. Our findings are of utmost interest given the ubiquitous presence of directed multilayer networks and the widespread use of disease-like spreading processes in a broad range of phenomena such as diffusion processes in social and transportation systems. Directionality in contact networks has often been disregarded, either because of the lack of data or in order to simplify theoretical approaches [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib1"{$>$}1{$<$}/a{$>$}]. This is the case of disease spreading models, which usually consider the underlying networks as undirected [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib2"{$>$}2{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib3"{$>$}3{$<$}/a{$>$}]. However, there are scenarios in which directionality has been found to be a key feature. Relevant examples are the case of meerkats in which transmission varies between groomers and groomees [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib4"{$>$}4{$<$}/a{$>$}] and the transmission of HIV between humans, with male-to-female transmission being 2.3 times greater than female-to-male transmission [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib5"{$>$}5{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Similarly, when addressing the problem of diseases that can be transmitted among different species, it is important to account for the fact that they might be able to spread from one type of host to the other, but not the other way around. For example, the bubonic plague can be endemic in rodent populations and spread to humans and other animals under certain conditions. If it evolves to the pneumonic form, it may then spread from human to human [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib6"{$>$}6{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Analogously, Andes virus usually spreads within rodent populations, but it can be transmitted to humans and then spread via person-to-person contacts [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib7"{$>$}7{$<$}/a{$>$}]. These types of interspecies contagions and other similar cases can be studied using multilayer networks, in which the network of each species is encoded in the layers and the possible interspecies interactions are given by the links that connect the layers [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib8"{$>$}8{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Human behavior by itself can also introduce asymmetric patterns of disease spreading, either via the transmission mechanisms or via asymmetries in social mixing [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib9"{$>$}9{$<$}/a{$>$}]. For instance, vaccination might induce asymmetric interactions among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib10"{$>$}10{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Similarly, large-scale cooperation [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib11"{$>$}11{$<$}/a{$>$}] can hinder disease spreading via peer punishment (e.g. prohibiting traveling if infected) and peer rewarding (e.g. free medical treatment from organizations). Both peer punishment and peer rewarding would deviate individual interactions far from symmetry, also inducing directionality in disease contagion. Even more, the own dynamics of the entities producing the diseases might be asymmetrical. For example, the interplay between cancer and the immune system can show asymmetric relationships [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib12"{$>$}12{$<$}/a{$>$}]. There are also diseases with long latent periods that induce complicated dynamics between individuals who develop further the disease and those who do not, such as the interaction between individuals in the primary infection phase of Tuberculosis and those in the active state [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib13"{$>$}13{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib14"{$>$}14{$<$}/a{$>$}]. For those cases, multilayer networks might be able to help disentangling dynamics that would be otherwise hidden. The use of directed multilayer networks is not constrained to diseases that can infect human populations. Indeed, analogous scenarios can be found in the interface between wildlife and livestock, with diseases being endemic in one of them and then being transmitted unidirectionaly to the other [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab3dd0bib15"{$>$}15{$<$}/a{$>$}]. This directionality is particularly relevant  {$<$}p{$>$}-Abstract Truncated-{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Besides, various evolutionary phases of insects and the corresponding driving forces of diversification remain to be recognized. In this study, a comprehensive sample of all insect orders was used to reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships and estimate deep divergences. The phylogenetic relationships of insect orders were congruently recovered by Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses. A complete timescale of divergences based on an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock model was established among all lineages of winged insects. The inferred timescale for various nodes are congruent with major historical events including the increase of atmospheric oxygen in the Late Silurian and earliest Devonian, the radiation of vascular plants in the Devonian, and with the available fossil record of the stem groups to various insect lineages in the Devonian and Carboniferous.},

Based upon a consideration of human social life and a functional design analysis of depression's core symptomatology we offer a comprehensive theory of its adaptive significance called the Social Navigation Hypothesis (SNH). The SNH attempts to account for all intensities of depression based on standard evolutionary theories of sociality, communication and psychological pain. The SNH suggests that depression evolved to perform two complimentary social problem-solving functions. First, depression induces cognitive changes that focus and enhance capacities for the accurate analysis and solution of key social problems, suggesting a social rumination function. Second, the costs associated with the anhedonia and psychomotor perturbation of depression can persuade reluctant social partners to provide help or make concessions via two possible mechanisms, namely, honest signaling and passive, unintentional fitness extortion. Thus it may also have a social motivation function. \textcopyright{} Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Most evolutionary explanations for cranial differences between Neandertals and modern humans emphasize adaptation by natural selection. Features of the crania of Neandertals could be adaptations to the glacial climate of Pleistocene Europe or to the high mechanical strains produced by habitually using the front teeth as tools, while those of modern humans could be adaptations for articulate speech production. A few researchers have proposed non-adaptive explanations. These stress that isolation between Neandertal and modern human populations would have lead to cranial diversification by genetic drift (chance changes in the frequencies of alleles at genetic loci contributing to variation in cranial morphology). Here we use a variety of statistical tests founded on explicit predictions from quantitative- and population-genetic theory to show that genetic drift can explain cranial differences between Neandertals and modern humans. These tests are based on thirty-seven standard cranial measurements from a sample of 2524 modern humans from 30 populations and 20 Neandertal fossils. As a further test, we compare our results for modern human cranial measurements with those for a genetic dataset consisting of 377 microsatellites typed for a sample of 1056 modern humans from 52 populations. We conclude that rather than requiring special adaptive accounts, Neandertal and modern human crania may simply represent two outcomes from a vast space of random evolutionary possibilities. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

To gain a deeper understanding of the use and application of animal social network analysis, we systematically surveyed the literature and extracted information on publication trends from articles using social network analysis. We synthesize trends in social network research over time and highlight variation in the use of different aspects of social network analysis. The use of social network analysis in empirical articles has increased over time. In the context of social network methods, we found that many studies did not use an association index to account for missing individuals or observations of individuals; that the number and type of social network metrics calculated in a given study varied substantially (median~=~2); and that focal observation was by far the most common method used to generate social networks, although the use of biologging devices increased over time. We also observed that most species studied using social networks are mammals (55\%) or birds (23\%), and that the majority are species of least concern (59\%; International Union for the Conservation of Nature, IUCN, {$<$}a href="http://www.iucn.org" target="\_blank"{$>$}www.iucn.org{$<$}/a{$>$}). Based on our findings, we highlight four key recommendations for future studies: (1) the use of association indices is almost always necessary; (2) the a priori selection of specific network metrics and associated hypotheses increases transparency; (3) combination of focal observation with biologging devices could improve our understanding of remotely sensed behaviours; and (4) because most studies rarely study species of conservation concern, it may be practical to generate networks for similar species or populations, which could help inform management decisions. We highlight emerging trends in social network research that may be valuable for distinct groups of social network researchers: students new to social network analysis, experienced behavioural ecologists interested in using social network analysis and advanced social network users interested in trends of social network research. Our findings also shed light on past research and provide guidance for future studies using social network analysis.{$<$}/p{$><$}/div{$><$}/div{$>$}}

The resulting graphical representations of shape differences are visually appealing and intuitive. This paper serves as an introduction to common exploratory and confirmatory techniques in landmark-based geometric morphometrics. The issues most frequently faced by (paleo)biologists conducting studies of comparative morphology are covered. Acquisition of landmark and semilandmark data is discussed. There are several methods for superimposing landmark configu-rations, differing in how and in the degree to which among-configuration differences in location, scale, and size are removed. Partial Procrustes superimposition is the most widely used superimposition method and forms the basis for many subsequent operations in geometric morphometrics.},

The standard explanation is that our percepts are biased toward our prior beliefs. However, reported psychophysical data suggest that this view may be simplistic. We propose a new model formulation based on efficient coding that is fully specified for any given natural stimulus distribution. The model makes two new and seemingly anti-Bayesian predictions. First, it predicts that perception is often biased away from an observer's prior beliefs. Second, it predicts that stimulus uncertainty differentially affects perceptual bias depending on whether the uncertainty is induced by internal or external noise. We found that both model predictions match reported perceptual biases in perceived visual orientation and spatial frequency, and were able to explain data that have not been explained before. The model is general and should prove applicable to other perceptual variables and tasks.},

Overall, more than one-half of the women reported having pretended orgasm during sexual intercourse. In univariate analyses, the "pretenders" and "non-pretenders" did not differ in experimenter-rated facial attractiveness, self-rated body attractiveness, or general self-monitoring. However, pretenders were significantly older; viewed themselves as facially more attractive, reported having had first intercourse at a younger age; reported greater numbers of lifetime intercourse, fellatio, and cunnilingus partners; and scored higher on measures of sexual esteem and erotophilia. In multivariate analyses, only sexual esteem was uniquely related to having pretended orgasm.

In the oceans, the surveillance of fisheries is complex and inadequate, such that quantifying and locating nondeclared and illegal fisheries is persistently problematic. Given that these activities dramatically impact oceanic ecosystems, through overexploitation of fish stocks and bycatch of threatened species, innovative ways to monitor the oceans are urgently required. Here, we describe a concept of ``Ocean Sentinel'' using animals equipped with state-of-the-art loggers which monitor fisheries in remote areas. Albatrosses fitted with loggers detecting and locating the presence of vessels and transmitting the information immediately to authorities allowed an estimation of the proportion of nondeclared fishing vessels operating in national and international waters of the Southern Ocean. We found that in international waters, more than one-third of vessels had no Automatic Identification System operating; in national Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), this proportion was lower on average, but variable according to EEZ. Ocean Sentinel was also able to provide unpreceded information on the attraction of seabirds to vessels, giving access to crucial information for risk-assessment plans of threatened species. Attraction differed between species, age, and vessel activity. Fishing vessels attracted more birds than other vessels, and juveniles both encountered fewer vessels and showed a lower attraction to vessels than adults. This study shows that the development of technologies offers the potential of implementing conservation policies by using wide-ranging seabirds to patrol oceans.},

  abstract = {Genetic data indicate differences in speciation rate across latitudes, but underlying causes have been difficult to assess because a critical phase of the speciation process is initiated in allopatry, in which, by definition, individuals from different taxa do not interact. We conducted song playback experiments between 109 related pairs of mostly allopatric bird species or subspecies in Amazonia and North America to compare the rate of evolution of male discrimination of songs. Relative to local controls, the number of flyovers and approach to the speaker were higher in Amazonia. We estimate that responses to songs of relatives are being lost about 6 times more slowly in Amazonia than in North America. The slow loss of response holds even after accounting for differences in song frequency and song length. Amazonian species with year-round territories are losing aggressive responses especially slowly. We suggest the presence of many species and extensive interspecific territoriality favors recognition of songs sung by sympatric heterospecifics, which results in a broader window of recognition and hence an ongoing response to novel similar songs. These aggressive responses should slow the establishment of sympatry between recently diverged forms. If male responses to novel allopatric taxa reflect female responses, then premating reproductive isolation is also evolving more slowly in Amazonia. The findings are consistent with previously demonstrated slower recent rates of expansion of sister taxa into sympatry, slower rates of evolution of traits important for premating isolation, and slower rates of speciation in general in Amazonia than in temperate North America.}

As in other pair-bonding mammals, women seek dominant males, and men seek and guard young, fertile females. Recent work is then described on adolescent competitiveness, mate selection, and pair bonding. The outcomes of even childhood social competition can be profound, with healthy, early-maturing, attractive children deriving lifelong benefits. Adolescent competition is intense among girls as well as boys. Depression is more common for boys with few sex partners, and for girls with many. Based on cross-cultural data and on analysis of pubertal changes in girls and boys, it can be concluded that adolescents have an evolved propensity for early sexual experimentation, followed by more judicious mate choice. Yet the bond with a girl's first sex partner is often profound. Amorous infatuations are intense in both sexes and usually mitigate within 3 years, for plausible adaptive reasons. Early menarche and unmarried motherhood impose developmental disadvantages on children but may be an evolved adaptation for stressful family conditions and a shortage of marriageable men. Gaining an understanding of normal adolescence can help in diagnosing, preventing, and treating problematic behaviors.},

  abstract = {Social network methods have become a key tool for describing, modelling, and testing hypotheses about the social structures of animals. However, due to the non-independence of network data and the presence of confounds, specialized statistical techniques are often needed to test hypotheses in these networks. Datastream permutations, originally developed to test the null hypothesis of random social structure, have become a popular tool for testing a wide array of null hypotheses. In particular, they have been used to test whether exogenous factors are related to network structure by interfacing these permutations with regression models. Here, we show that these datastream permutations typically do not represent the null hypothesis of interest to researchers interfacing animal social network analysis with regression modelling, and use simulations to demonstrate the potential pitfalls of using this methodology. Our simulations show that utilizing common datastream permutations to test the coefficients of regression models can lead to extremely high type I (false-positive) error rates (\&gt; 30\%) in the presence of non-random social structure. The magnitude of this problem is primarily dependent on the degree of non-randomness within the social structure and the intensity of sampling. We strongly recommend against utilizing datastream permutations to test regression models in animal social networks. We suggest that a potential solution may be found in regarding the problems of non-independence of network data and unreliability of observations as separate problems with distinct solutions.}

This complexity has inspired inquiries into similarities of bird song to human language; but the quantitative analysis and description of song sequences is a challenging task. In this study, we analysed song sequences of common nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos) by means of a network analysis. We translated long nocturnal song sequences into networks of song types with song transitions as connectors. As network measures, we calculated shortest path length and transitivity and identified the 'small-world' character of nightingale song networks. Besides comparing network measures with conventional measures of song complexity, we also found a correlation between network measures and age of birds. Furthermore, we determined the numbers of in-coming and out-going edges of each song type, characterizing transition patterns. These transition patterns were shared across males for certain song types. Playbacks with different transition patterns provided first evidence that these patterns are responded to differently and thus play a role in singing interactions. We discuss potential functions of the network properties of song sequences in the framework of vocal leadership. Network approaches provide biologically meaningful parameters to describe the song structure of species with extremely large repertoires and complex rules of song retrieval.},

  abstract = {The singing of song birds can formcomplex signal systems comprised of numerous subunits sung with distinct combinatorial properties that have been described as syntax-like. This complexity has inspired inquiries into similarities of bird song to human language; but the quantitative analysis and description of song sequences is a challenging task. In this study, we analysed song sequences of commonnightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos) bymeans of a network analysis. We translated long nocturnal song sequences into networks of song types with song transitions as connectors. As network measures, we calculated shortest path length and transitivity and identified the 'small-world' character of nightingale song networks. Besides comparing networkmeasureswith conventional measures of song complexity, we also found a correlation between network measures and age of birds. Furthermore, we determined the numbers of in-coming and out-going edges of each song type, characterizing transition patterns. These transition patternswere shared acrossmales for certain song types. Playbacks with different transition patterns provided first evidence that these patterns are responded to differently and thus play a role in singing interactions. We discuss potential functions of the network properties of song sequences in the framework of vocal leadership. Network approaches provide biologically meaningful parameters to describe the song structure of species with extremely large repertoires and complex rules of song retrieval. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We apply all 3 methods suggested by Gustav Fechner (preference, production, and use; Fechner 1871, 1876) to visual geometrical patterns, showing that symmetrical patterns are not only used most frequently in real life but are also produced spontaneously in the lab and are rated as significantly more attractive than are random patterns. We demonstrate that an anticipated audience affects the pleasingness of geometrical patterns produced by participants in the laboratory. Visual patterns created by participants instructed to make patterns that others will like are indeed rated more highly than are those that were made under the instruction to make patterns that are mainly pleasing to the producer.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Social relationships are composed of both positive (affiliative) and negative (agonistic) interactions, representing opposing effects. Social network theory predicts that positive relationships should be transitive; thus, the friend of a friend is more likely to be a friend. Further, when considering both positive and negative relationships jointly, structural balance theory predicts that certain configurations of positive and negative relationships in a triad are inherently less stable (unbalanced) and should tend to be eliminated. However, structural balance has been rarely examined in nonhuman social systems. We tested for transitivity and structural balance in social networks of socially flexible yellow-bellied marmots ({$<$}em{$>$}Marmota flaviventer{$<$}/em{$>$}) and asked if group size, network density, or group composition affected the degree of structural balance. We found a consistent pattern of significant transitivity in positive interactions, some transitivity in negative interactions, and some evidence of structural balance. In particular, a "weak" definition of structural balance is probably more common than "strong" structural balance, which used a stricter definition of balance. Network size limited the ability to detect these social processes, and smaller networks were less likely to show significant transitivity or structural balance. The proportion of adult females in a group affected the level of transitivity but did not affect the degree of structural balance. Our study suggests that there are intriguing similarities in social processes across diverse animal societies and that studying triads and network motifs may help identify basic social mechanisms linking local to global structure.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}h3{$>$}Significance statement{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Social network theory predicts that basic social mechanisms should lead to similar structural properties across different societies. For example, positive relationships should be transitive (a friend of a friend is a friend), and certain combinations of positive and negative relationships represent conflict and should be unstable over time (e.g., a friend of a friend being an enemy is an unstable state). This latter theory, called structural balance, has rarely been examined in nonhuman societies; hence, we tested for transitivity and structural balance in groups of free-living yellow-bellied marmots. Positive interactions were generally transitive, but evidence for structural balance was inconsistent. Furthermore, group composition could affect network transitivity, and small network size (associated with few interactions) limits ability to detect significant patterns. Our results suggest that transitivity is fundamental in structuring positive relationships, while some forms of structural balance are present but not widespread.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

We expand these results to allow for more complex population structures, and demonstrate that for learners on undirected graphs the distribution of languages will also reflect the prior distribution. We then use techniques borrowed from statistical physics to obtain deeper insight into language evolution, finding that although population structure will not influence the probability that an individual speaks a given language, it will influence how likely neighbors are to speak the same language. These analyses lift a restrictive assumption of iterated learning, and suggest that experimental and mathematical findings using iterated learning may apply to a wider range of settings.},

The adaptive advantage of social learning depends crucially on the ability of each learner to obtain relevant and accurate information from informants. The source of informants' knowledge is a particularly important cue for evaluating advice from multiple informants; if the informants share the source of their information or have obtained their information from each other, then their testimony is statistically dependent and may be less reliable than testimony from informants who do not share information. In this study, we use a Bayesian model to determine how rational learners should incorporate the effects of shared information when learning from other people, conducting three experiments that examine whether human learners behave similarly. We find that people are sensitive to a number of different pat-terns of dependency, supporting the use of a sophisticated strategy for social learning that goes beyond copying the majority, and broadening the situations in which social learning is likely to be an adaptive strategy.},

We took advantage of a strongly philopatric, known-age and known-parentage island population to examine the influence of five tutor types on song learning: a bird's social father, genetic father, natal neighbours, older breeding-year neighbours and 1-year-old breeding-year neighbours. Of 57 males banded as nestlings, there was wide variation in the tutor type with the greatest influence on song learning. Based on pairwise visual comparisons of spectrograms of all co-occurring males plus quantitative measures of similarity of digitized songs, only 12\% of males sang songs that were most strongly influenced by their social father, as inferred by overall similarity of entire songs. About 45\% of males were the product of extrapair paternity, but no male sang a song that was most similar to his genetic (versus social) father. Thirty-five per cent of males produced songs that were most similar to those of natal neighbours, 26\% sang songs most like older breeding-year neighbours and 26\% sang songs most like 1-year-old breeding-year neighbours. Neither a male's body condition at fledging nor his fledging date was related to tutor type, and tutors did not differ from nontutors in morphology, longevity or reproductive success. Savannah sparrows apparently draw upon a wide set of models heard in both their hatching and their breeding years, incorporating specific song elements into their own song rather than copying in its entirety any particular tutor's song. \textcopyright{} 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

We use an individual-based evolutionary model to show that, in environmental conditions dominated by low-frequency variation ("red noise"), extirpation mrved.ay be an outcome of the evolution of cultural capacity. Previous analytical models predicted an equilibrium between individual learners and social learners, or a contingent strategy in which individuals learn socially or individually depending on the circumstances. However, in red noise environments, whose main signature is that variation is concentrated in relatively large, relatively rare excursions, individual learning may be selected from the population. If the social learning system comes to lack sufficient individual learning or cognitively costly adaptive biases, behavior ceases tracking environmental variation. Then, when the environment does change, fitness declines and the population may collapse or even be extirpated. The modeled scenario broadly fits some human population collapses and might also explain nonhuman extirpations. Varying model parameters showed that the fixation of social learning is less likely when individual learning is less costly, when the environment is less red or more variable, with larger population sizes, and when learning is not conformist or is from parents rather than from the general population. Once social learning is fixed, extirpation is likely except when social learning is biased towards successful models. Thus, the risk of population collapse may be reduced by promoting individual learning and innovation over cultural conformity, or by preferential selection of relatively fit individuals as models for social learning. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

For continuous behavioural variables we modelled three forms of dyadic social learning, averaging the behavioural value of the two individuals, random transfer of information from one individual to the other, and directional transfer from the individual with highest behavioural value to the other. Learning had potential error. We also examined the transfer of categorical behaviour between individuals with random directionality and two forms of error, the adoption of a randomly chosen existing behavioural category or the innovation of a new type of behaviour. In populations without social structuring the diversity of culturally transmitted behaviour increased with learning error and population size. When the populations were structured socially either by making individuals members of permanent social units or by giving them overlapping ranges, behavioural diversity increased with network modularity under all scenarios, although the proportional increase varied considerably between continuous and categorical behaviour, with transmission mechanism, and population size. Although functions of the form ec1m-c2+c3Log(N) predicted the mean increase in diversity with modularity (m) and population size (N), behavioural diversity could be highly unpredictable both between simulations with the same set of parameters, and within runs. Errors in social learning and social structuring generally promote behavioural diversity. Consequently, social learning may be considered to produce culture in populations whose social structure is sufficiently modular.},

By contrast, recent decades have seen a massive growth in the documentation of such cultural phenomena, driven by long- term field studies and complementary laboratory experiments. Here, I review the burgeoning scope of discoveries in this field, which increasingly suggest that this `second inheritance system', built on the shoulders of the primary genetic inheritance system, occurs widely among vertebrates and possibly in invertebrates too. Its novel characteristics suggest significant implications for our understanding of evolutionary biology. I assess the extent to which this second system extends the scope of evolution, both by echoing principal properties of the primary, organic evolutionary system, and going beyond it in significant ways. This is well established in human cultural evolution; here, I address animal cultures more generally. The further major, and related, question concerns the extent to which the conse- quences of widespread animal cultural transmission interact with the primary, genetically based inheritance systems, shaping organic evolution.},

I then address the other meaning of the term focused on cultural changes within a lineage. Such changes in humans, described as ``cumulative cultural evolution,'' have been spectacular, but relatively little attention has yet been paid to the topic in nonhuman animals, other than asserting that the process is unique to humans. A variety of evidence including both controlled experiments and field observations has begun to challenge this view, and in some behavioral domains, notably birdsong, cultural evolution has been studied for many years.

This situation begs the question, what role is there for the anthropology of mental health? In this essay, I contend that there are three essential roles for the anthropology of mental health in an era of biological psychiatry. These roles are to (i) provide a meaningful critique of practices, beliefs, and movements within current psychiatry; (ii) illuminate the socio-cultural, clinical, and familial context of suffering and healing regarding emotional distress/mental illness; and (iii) act as a catalyst for positive change regarding healing, services and provisions for people with emotional distress/mental illness. My argument is unified by my contention that a credible anthropology of mental health intending to make a societal contribution should offer no opposition without proposition. In other words, any critique must be counter-balanced by the detailing of solutions and proposals for change. This will ensure that the anthropology of mental health continues to contribute critical knowledge to the understanding of mental suffering, distress, and healing. Such social and cultural approaches are becoming especially important given the widespread disenchantment with an increasingly dominant biological psychiatry.},

NBDA infers social learning if the spread of a novel behavior follows the social network and hence relies on appropriate information on individuals' network connections. Most studies on animal populations, however, lack a complete record of all associations, which creates uncertainty in the social network. To reduce this uncertainty, researchers often use a certain threshold of sightings for the inclusion of animals (which is often arbitrarily chosen), as observational error decreases with increasing numbers of observations. Dropping individuals with only few sightings, however, can lead to information loss in the network if connecting individuals are removed. Hence, there is a trade-off between including as many individuals as possible and having reliable data. We here provide a tool in R that assesses the sensitivity of NBDA to error in the social network given a certain threshold for the inclusion~of individuals. It simulates a social learning process through a population and then tests the power of NBDA to reliably detect social learning after introducing observational error into the social network, which is repeated for different thresholds. Our tool can help researchers using NBDA to select a threshold, specific to their data set, that maximizes power to reliably quantify social learning in their study population.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

In particular, we explore whether different transmission modes result in sufficiently different distributions of the average time a variant stays the most common variant in the population, tmax, so that their inference can be guaranteed on the basis of an estimate of tmax. We assume time series data detailing the frequencies of different variants of a cultural trait in a population at different points in time and investigate the temporal resolution (i.e., the length of the time series and the distance between consecutive time points) that is needed to ensure distinguishability between transmission modes. We find that under complete information most transmission modes can be distinguished on the basis of the statistic tmax; however, we should not expect the same results if only infrequent information about the most common cultural variant in the population is available.},

  abstract = {1. Population density often has strong effects on the population dynamics and reproductive processes of territorial animals. However, most estimates of density-dependent effects use the number of breeding pairs per unit area in a given season and look for correlations across seasons, a technique that assigns the same density score to each breeding pair, irrespective of local spatial variation. 2. In this study, we employed GIS techniques to estimate individual breeding densities for great tits breeding in Wytham Woods UK, between 1965 and 1996. We then used linear mixed modelling to analyse the effect of density on reproductive processes. 3. The areas of Thiessen polygons formed around occupied nestboxes were used to approximate territory size (necessarily inverse of breeding density). There were significant, independent and positive relationships between clutch size, fledging mass and the number of offspring recruited to the population, and territory size (all P {$<$} 0.001), but no effect of territory size on lay-date or egg mass. 4. Thiessen polygons are contiguous and cover all of the available area. Therefore, at low nest densities territory polygons were excessively oversized. Using a novel procedure to address this limitation, territory sizes were systematically capped through a range of maxima, with the greatest effect in the models when territories were capped at 0.9-2.3 ha. This figure approximates to the maximum effective territory size in our population and is in close agreement with several field-based studies. This capping refinement also revealed a significant negative relationship between lay-date and territory size capped at 0.9 ha (P {$<$} 0.001). 5. These density-dependent effects were also detected when analyses were restricted to changes within individual females, suggesting that density effects do not merely result from either increased proportions of low-quality individuals, or increased occupation of poor sites, when population density is high. 6. Overall, these results suggest that, in the current population, great tits with territories smaller than c. 2 ha independently lay smaller and later clutches, have lighter fledglings, and recruit fewer offspring to the breeding population. These analyses thus suggest a pervasive and causal role of local population density in explaining individual reproductive processes. \textcopyright{} 2006 British Ecological Society.},

The reproductive output offorest passerines is often reduced close to forest edges. Possible explanations include overcrowding by conspecifics, elevated rates of predation, and the occurrence of lower-quality habitat and/or individuals at forest edges. We attempted to separate these processes by examining edge effects in the absence of nest predation and by effectively controlling for differences in breeding density and the quality of habitats and individuals. We used an edge distance index (EDI), which accounts for the number and distribution of edges in close proximity to a breeding location, to help explain variation in breeding density, nesting success, and reproductive traits of 8308 pairs of Great Tits (Parus major) breeding between 1965 and 2005, in Wytham, near Oxford, United Kingdom. Results from linear mixed modeling confirmed higher breeding density and a higher proportion of immigrant individuals at forest edges. Nevertheless, independently of these effects, we also found that birds laying later, with smaller clutches but larger eggs, were typical of edge environments. The number of offspring recruited to the breeding offspring per breeding attempt was also reduced at edges, both directly and mediated through changes in clutch size and laying date. Edge effects on life histories were detectable within individual females and up to 500 m from the woodland edge. Woodland edges are increasingly common in contemporary fragmented landscapes. Therefore these results, which suggest a pervasive effect of edges on reproduction, are of considerable importance to the management and conservation offorest communities.},

Some of these traits also appear in domesticated birds and fish. The origin of Darwin's "domestication syndrome" has remained a conundrum for more than 140 years. Most explanations focus on particular traits, while neglecting others, or on the possible selective factors involved in domestication rather than the underlying developmental and genetic causes of these traits. Here, we propose that the domestication syndrome results predominantly from mild neural crest cell deficits during embryonic development. Most of the modified traits, both morphological and physiological, can be readily explained as direct consequences of such deficiencies, while other traits are explicable as indirect consequences. We first show how the hypothesis can account for the multiple, apparently unrelated traits of the syndrome and then explore its genetic dimensions and predictions, reviewing the available genetic evidence. The article concludes with a brief discussion of some genetic and developmental questions raised by the idea, along with specific predictions and experimental tests.},

It is predicted from these simulations that having more neighbours will lead to song types lasting for less time in the population, to greater sharing of song types between birds, to song types being shared by spatially separated groups of birds more often, and to a lower proportion of the repertoire being shared between neighbours. Where repertoire sizes are larger the simulations suggest that song types should persist for longer, but they predict little effect on the number of birds sharing a type and no tendency for these birds to split into separate groups. The larger the repertoire the smaller the proportion of it expected to be shared between pairs of neighbours. Comparison with data on the frequency of different songs in a chaffinch population gave a goodness of fit of the simulations to the data that did not vary with repertoire size. However, more simulations with four neighbours matched the data than did ones with two or eight. This number of neighbours was also the most realistic for the population in question. It is concluded that both repertoire size and numbers of neighbours are likely to have a marked impact on various aspects of song distribution in wild populations. \textcopyright{} 1990 Academic Press Limited.},

Evidence from sex chromosome aneuploidies and an association within families between sex and handedness is consistent with the presence of a determinant of cerebral asymmetry (a possible correlate of language) on the X and the Y chromosomes. During hominid evolution a 3.5 Mb translocation occurred from the ancestral X chromosome to the Y chromosome, resulting in duplication of the Protocadherin11X gene, such that it is represented on the X and Y chromosomes in man, whereas there is a single X-linked gene in other mammals. We re-date the duplicative translocation to 6 million years ago, that is, close to the chimpanzee-hominid bifurcation. Sequence comparisons with the chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan indicate that in contrast to earlier purifying selection there has been accelerated change in the Protocadherin11X ectodomain as well as the Protocadherin11Y sequence in the hominid lineage since the duplication. The evolutionary sequence of events together with the prior case for an X-Y homologous gene suggests that this gene-pair is a candidate for the evolution of hominid-specific characteristics including the sexual dimorphism of cerebral asymmetry, a putative correlate of language.},

Sex-specific traits evolve by the gain, loss or modification of linkages in the genetic networks regulated by sex-determination transcription factors.},

  abstract = {Cultural evolution can result in changes in the prevalence not only of different learned song types within bird populations but also of different segments within the song. Between 1980 and 2011, we examined changes within different segments of the single songs of male Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichiensis, in an island population. Introductory notes did not change. The buzz segment showed similar stability; although a rare low-frequency variant appeared and then disappeared, the buzz segments from 1980 and 2011 were essentially identical. The middle segment, made up of discrete notes assembled into several types, was variable. However, the form of the middle segment did not affect fitness and may serve to denote individual identity. The terminal trill decreased steadily in frequency and duration over three decades. Longer trills were associated with lower reproductive success, suggesting that trill duration was under sexual selection. The notes sung between introductory notes were also associated with reproductive success. A high cluster sung in 1980-1982 disappeared altogether by 2011, and was gradually replaced by click trains, which were associated with greater reproductive success. During the final decade of the study, more clicks were added to click trains. Longer click trains, which may require vocal virtuosity and so indicate male quality, were also associated with greater reproductive success. Both trill duration and the number of clicks increased in variance during the three-decade span of the study. We suggest that such increases in variance might be a signature of directional cultural selection. Within the Savannah sparrow's relatively short and simple learned song, cultural evolution appears to be mediated by different mechanisms for different song segments, perhaps because the segments convey different information. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

To identify individual members of the communities of practice who were involved in the creation of parietal art in the Franco-Cantabrian region we have analysed the age and the sex of the people who 'decorated' the caves. Secondly, by following the analysis of lines created by flutings by different members of the community of practice, we suggest that children under the age of seven, who had no the cognitive abilities to comprehend the meaning of images, were active and prolific fluters and performed acts of decorating cave walls by themselves or with the support of other community members. This approach allows us to consider parietal art as community art where visual contributions were created by community members of all age and sexes.},

  abstract = {Different components of learned birdsongs change at different rates across generations, and the rate of change may correspond to the information carried by each component. To characterize the role of the buzz segment of Savannah sparrow songs, we examined recordings from southeastern Canada and the northeastern US and fully characterized buzz segments in songs recorded from two populations: one on Kent Island, NB, Canada and another in Williamstown, MA, USA. Buzzes varied geographically: Kent Island buzzes had higher mean frequencies and shorter pulse periods than Williamstown buzzes and the differences between the two populations persisted over time. Population-specific buzz characteristics also appeared to be resistant to change. Variants appeared on Kent Island in the late 1980s and were learned by some younger birds; however, these buzz variants disappeared by 2011. We conducted a playback experiment and found that males from both populations had longer responses to local buzzes. Therefore, buzz structure varies geographically; population characteristics of the buzz persist through time despite the introduction of variant forms; and territorial males discriminate between buzzes from different populations. The learned buzz segment of the song may thus serve as a population marker for Savannah sparrows.},

  abstract = {In studies of cumulative cultural evolution in non-human animals, the focus is most often on incremental changes that increase the efficacy of an existing form of socially learned behaviour, such as the refinement of migratory pathways. In this paper, we compare the songs of different species to describe patterns of evolution in the acoustic structure of bird songs, and explore the question of what building blocks might underlie cumulative cultural evolution of bird song using a comparative approach. We suggest that three steps occurred: first, imitation of independent sounds, or notes, via social learning; second, the formation of categories of note types; and third, assembling note types into sequences with defined structures. Simple sequences can then be repeated to form simple songs or concatenated with other sequences to form segmented songs, increasing complexity. Variant forms of both the notes and the sequencing rules may then arise due to copy errors and innovation. Some variants may become established in the population because of learning biases or selection, increasing signal efficiency, or because of cultural drift. Cumulative cultural evolution of bird songs thus arises from cognitive processes such as vocal imitation, categorization during memorization and learning biases applied to basic acoustic building blocks.

Prominent among environmental influences is the society in which a person develops: and it is his position in this constellation of people, with their shared ethos and world view, which molds experience, cognition, and affect (2). Cultural meanings, norms, and power arrangements shape illness to a great degree by defining the sick role and consequent illness behaviors. Medical anthropology, as a discipline, has among its concerns the cultural content of health and illness behaviors: it includes studies of how social experiences define sickness and shape ideas of disease recognition and therapy (3) . Both physician and patient offer, either unconsciously or consciously, explanatory models of disease and expectations of the health care system which form a continuum ranging from full agreement to mutual disregard (4). These observations spring from a cursory glance at even a single society and accumulate greater power when comparative cultural studies are involved, as is the case in cross-cultural psychiatry.},

This hypothesis predicts that a floater or immigrant male that sings local song types may be perceived as a territory owner and benefit from the reduced aggression commonly observed between established neighbours ('dear enemy' effect). The present study employed a field playback experiment to test the short-term ability of mimics to deceive territorial male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia. A set of three nonshared song type stimuli was presented to individual focal birds from the territory boundary of an adjacent male: a song type recorded from this adjacent neighbour (Neighbour), and two from non-neighbouring males that were an unfamiliar song type (Stranger) and a song type in the neighbour's repertoire (Mimic). The behavioural response to the Mimic was often as strong as, and sometimes stronger than, the response to the Stranger and was significantly more aggressive than to the Neighbour. Thus most birds accurately assessed the Mimic as a non-neighbouring invader. This study also revealed a significant negative correlation between the number of songs a subject shared with his neighbour and his aggressive response to the Neighbour stimulus. Song sharing is associated with reduced aggression between neighbours, but the mechanism is not deceptive mimicry. In this species with age-restricted learning, song sharing may serve as an indicator of a bird's competitive strength and ability to establish and maintain a territory near his adult song tutors. \textcopyright{} 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

This was in an earlier day when concerns with logical structure and ontological simplicity reigned supreme. Ontological genocide was practiced upon whole classes of upper-level or "derivative" entities in the name of elegance, and we were secure in the belief that one strayed irremediably into the realm of conceptual confusion and possible error the further one got from ontic fundamentalism. In those days, one paid more attention to generic worries about possible errors (motivated by our common training in philosophical scepticism) than to actual errors derived from distancing oneself too far from the nitty-gritty details of actual theory, actual inferences from actual data, the actual conditions under which we posited and detected entities, calibrated and "burned in" instruments, identified and rejected artifacts, debugged programs and procedures, explained the mechanisms behind regularities, judged correlations to be spurious, and in general, the real complexities and richness of actual scientific practice. The belief that logic and philosophy were prior to any possible science has had a number of distorting effects on philosophy of science. One of these was that for ontology, we seemed never to be able to reject the null hypothesis: "Don't multiply entities beyond necessity."},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic noise can interfere with animal behavior through masking of acoustic communication. In response to masking, animals may change their acoustic signals as an apparent adjustment strategy, but this may have a drawback on signal quality. Songs and calls may show noise-dependent changes in frequency and duration, which may yield some masking avoidance, but may also constrain other acoustic parameters that might carry information about the sender. In the present study, we investigated whether noise-dependent reduction in frequency bandwidth or song duration restricted syllable diversity or song elaboration in a Neotropical songbird, the bananaquit (Coereba flaveola). We show that bananaquits sing higher frequency songs, of narrower bandwidth, in noisier territories, independent of variation in territory density, without significant variation in song duration. We also show that songs with higher minimum frequencies, narrower bandwidths, and shorter durations have on average a lower number of syllable types and higher syllable rates. This finding is in line with an acoustic restriction and may reflect a functional trade-off between audibility and signal value: higher frequencies may be more audible but less elaborate songs may weaken the message of sender quality. Consequently, noise pollution may not only alter avian communities, but also shape acoustic diversity and processes of sexual selection in urban environments.},

Building on apparently unrelated results, here I propose that RNA-containing nanovesicles, predominantly small regulatory RNAs, are released from somatic tissues in the bloodstream, cross the Weismann barrier, reach the epididymis, and are eventually taken up by spermatozoa; henceforth the information is delivered to oocytes at fertilization. In the model, a LINE-1-encoded reverse transcriptase activity, present in spermatozoa and early embryos, plays a key role in amplifying and propagating these RNAs as extrachromosomal structures. It may be conceived that, over generations, the cumulative effects of sperm-delivered RNAs would cross a critical threshold and overcome the buffering capacity of embryos. As a whole, the process can promote the generation of an information-containing platform that drives the reshaping of the embryonic epigenetic landscape with the potential to generate ontogenic changes and redirect the evolutionary trajectory. Over time, evolutionary significant, stably acquired variations could be generated through the process. The interplay between these elements defines the concept of ``evolutionary field'', a self-consistent, comprehensive information-containing platform and a source of discontinuous evolutionary novelty.},

How eggshell colours help maintain thermal balance is a long-standing and contested question. Using data spanning a wide phylogenetic diversity of birds on a global spatial scale, we find evidence that eggshell pigmentation may have been shaped by thermoregulatory needs. Birds living in cold habitats, particularly those with nests exposed to incident solar radiation, have darker eggs. We show evidence that darker eggs heat more rapidly than lighter ones when exposed to solar radiation. This evidence suggests that egg pigmentation could play an important role in thermoregulation in cold climates, while a range of competing selective pressures further influence eggshell colours in warmer climates. These findings advance our understanding of thermoregulation in the distribution of natural colours.}

In contrast to females where X inactivation is seen; the X chromosome of the male stays active. When, due to meiotic non-disjunction events, males are born with a supernumerary X chromosome, the resulting 47, XXY karyotype is referred to as Klinefelter's syndrome. This frequent genetic condition is most commonly associated with infertility, hypogonadism, gynecomastia and cognitive impairments. The condition has also been associated with a reduced life expectancy, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, increased body fat mass and reduced bone mineral content. In a variety of species, male animals with karyotypes resembling Klinefelter's syndrome arise and develop a subset of features similar to those seen in humans. The availability of these animals is driving efforts to experimentally address the pathophysiology of the condition. To date, two models, 41, XXY and 41, XX(Y)* (mutated Y chromosome) male mice, have been established which resemble aspects of the pathophysiology of Klinefelter's syndrome. Experiments performed in these models confirm that the presence of a supernumerary X chromosome causes germ cell loss, cognitive deficits, Leydig cell hyperplasia, and that their Sertoli cells are capable of supporting germ cells of normal karyotype. This review summarizes the generation and characterization of the animal models for Klinefelter's syndrome and suggests experimental strategies to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of Klinefelter's syndrome.},

During the past five years significant progress has been made moving from a descriptive to a more mechanistic understanding of how FoxP2 functions in songbirds. Current evidence from molecular and electrophysiological studies indicates that FoxP2 is important for shaping synaptic plasticity of specific neuron populations. One future goal will be to identify the transcriptional regulation orchestrated by FoxP2 and its associated molecular network that brings about these physiological effects. This will be key to further unravel how FoxP2 influences synaptic function and thereby contributes to auditory guided vocal motor behavior in the songbird model. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The main goal of this study was to characterize C dynamics and net C exchange over two full crop years at two sites in the inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW). The iPNW is a highly productive dryland wheat growing region. The two measurement sites represent the low- and high-end of the regional precipitation gradient (250 and 550mmyear-1, respectively). The low rainfall site is in a winter wheat-fallow rotation, while the high rainfall site is under continuous cropping with a rotation that includes winter wheat and pulse crops. The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was monitored using the eddy covariance method. The winter wheat cropping years were strong CO2 sinks, with net uptake of 517{$\pm$}26 and 524{$\pm$}29gCm-2year-1 at the high- and low-rainfall sites, respectively. The fallow and pulse-crop years were close to neutral with respect to NEE, with a net uptake of 20{$\pm$}38gCm-2year-1 for garbanzo beans at the high rainfall site, and a net loss of 3{$\pm$}19gCm-2year-1 for the fallow season at the low rainfall site. Combining NEE with other carbon exchange terms, most importantly carbon import and export via seeding and harvest, gives the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB). We found that even when harvest export was taken into account, both sites acted as net carbon sinks over the two year period: the NECB at the continuous cropping site was 202{$\pm$}60gCm-2, and the crop-fallow site had a NECB of 444{$\pm$}34gCm-2. These results present useful insights to field-scale C dynamics on finely resolved timescales. To understand the potential of soils as a long term C sink however, longer-term monitoring over multiple complete crop rotation cycles in combination with other field measurements or process-based models will be necessary.},

  abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring has proven effective for broad-scale population surveys of acoustically active species, making it a valuable tool for conserving threatened species. However, successful automated classification of anuran vocalisations in large audio datasets has been limited. We deployed five autonomous recording units at three known breeding areas of the Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus canorus), which is threatened and relatively uncommon, and the sympatric Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla), which is widespread and more common, to test the viability of bioacoustics as a means of supplementing ongoing, human survey efforts. We analysed the audio data with the BirdNET algorithm, which was originally developed for birds but has been expanded to include both species. We achieved efficient and accurate identification of both species in 2,756 h of audio, which yielded high-resolution phenological data about seasonal and daily vocal activity as well as daily detection counts. These findings demonstrate that a newly expanded machine learning detector, BirdNET, can effectively process passive acoustic surveys for these species. Further exploration of how passive acoustic monitoring may complement existing survey techniques for these and other Anurans is warranted.},

  abstract = {Age shapes fundamental processes related to behaviour, survival and reproduction, where age influences reproductive success, non-random mating with respect to age can magnify or mitigate such effects. Consequently, the correlation in partners' age across a population may influence its productivity. Despite widespread evidence for age-assortative mating, little is known about what drives this assortment and its variation. Specifically, the relative importance of active (same-age mate preference) and passive processes (assortment as a consequence of other spatial or temporal effects) in driving age assortment is not well understood. In this paper, we compare breeding data from a great tit and mute swan population (51- and 31-year datasets, respectively) to tease apart the contributions of pair retention, cohort age structure and active age-related mate selection to age assortment in species with contrasting life histories. Both species show age-assortative mating and variable assortment between years. However, we demonstrate that the drivers of age assortment differ between the species, as expected from their life histories and resultant demographic differences. In great tits, pair fidelity has a weak effect on age-assortative mating through pair retention; variation in age assortment is primarily driven by fluctuations in age structure from variable juvenile recruitment. Age-assortative mating is, therefore, largely passive, with no evidence consistent with active age-related mate selection. In mute swans, age assortment is partly explained by pair retention, but not population age structure, and evidence exists for active age-assortative pairing. This difference is likely to result from shorter life-spans in great tits compared with mute swans, leading to fundamental differences in their population age structure, whereby a larger proportion of great tit populations consist of a single age cohort. In mute swans, age-assortative pairing through mate selection may also be driven by greater age-dependent variation in fitness. The study highlights the importance of considering how different life histories and demographic differences arising from these affect population processes that appear congruent across species. We suggest that future research should focus on uncovering the proximate mechanisms that lead to variation in active age-assortative mate selection (as seen in mute swans); and the consequences of variation in age structure on the ecological and social functioning of wild populations.},

  abstract = {Continual evolution describes the unceasing evolution of at least one trait involving at least one organism. The Red Queen Hypothesis is a specific case in which continual evolution results from coevolution of at least two species. While microevolutionary studies have described examples in which evolution does not cease, understanding which general conditions lead to continual evolution or to stasis remains a major challenge. In many cases, it is unclear which experimental features or model assumptions are necessary for the observed continual evolution to emerge, and whether the described behavior is robust to variations in the given setup. Here, we aim to find the minimal set of conditions under which continual evolution occurs. To this end, we present a theoretical framework that does not assume any specific functional form and, therefore, can be applied to a wide variety of systems. Our framework is also general enough to make predictions about both monomorphic and polymorphic populations. We show that the combination of a fast positive and a slow negative feedback between environment, population, and evolving traits causes continual evolution to emerge even from the evolution of a single evolving trait, provided that the ecological timescale is sufficiently faster than the timescales of mutation and the negative feedback. Our approach and results thus contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary dynamics resulting from biotic interactions.}

We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis based in 135,458 cases and 344,901 controls and identified 44 independent and significant loci. The genetic findings were associated with clinical features of major depression and implicated brain regions exhibiting anatomical differences in cases. Targets of antidepressant medications and genes involved in gene splicing were enriched for smaller association signal. We found important relationships of genetic risk for major depression with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: lower educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal, whereas major depression and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for major depression. These findings help refine the basis of major depression and imply that a continuous measure of risk underlies the clinical phenotype.},

The addition of 82 pages to the original 364, largely devoted to new data, reminds us of the rapid increase of interest in this field, a development in which the appearance of the first edition played no mean role. Not only has much new material been added but there is evidence of careful revision throughout, including segregation of certain scattered portions into a new chapter, ``Patterns of Evolution.'' There is no other book which combines such, an extensive review and analysis of the present state of knowledge on the genetics of variability within wild populations, and of the differences among races and species, with an account of the statistical consequences to be expected from known genetic mechanisms in populations subject to selection, crossbreeding and the cumulative effect of accidents of sampling. There is continual effort to integrate the factual material with the mathematical theory. There is, however, no selection or other forcing of facts to fit theoretical patterns. The primary emphasis is on the facts in all their heterogeneity. \textcopyright{} 1942 Oxford University Press.}

  abstract = {Vocal dialects have fascinated biologists for over 50 years. This mosaic pattern of geographic variation in learned vocalisations was first described in a songbird, and since that time most studies investigating dialects have focused on songbird species. Here we examine patterns of geographic variation in the calls of a different group of vocal learning birds, the parrots (order Psittaciformes). We summarise the growing literature on vocal variation in parrots, and complement this review with a survey of variation in the genus Amazona using calls from sound libraries. We find strikingly similar patterns to those previously found in songbirds. Over 90\% of parrots examined in the literature, and 69\% of Amazona species surveyed, showed geographic variation consistent with a propensity to share local call types. This trait is evolutionarily labile and widespread; within Amazona most clades contained species with and without geographic variation, and most major lineages of parrots include representatives with dialects. We found little support for the long-standing hypothesis that dialects isolate populations and thus generate genetic differences among populations. Instead, most studies support the idea that dialects are maintained by social benefits of matching local call types, a finding that has implications for the management of captive and endangered populations. Considerable scope remains for studies that experimentally test hypotheses for the exact nature of these benefits, as well as studies that employ comparisons among species, to understand how the interplay between ecology, social dynamics and vocal learning capacities produces different patterns of variation across the parrots.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models enable practitioners to analyze large datasets of encounter records and make predictions about species occurrence at unsurveyed locations. In omnibus surveys that record data on multiple species simultaneously, species ranges are often nonoverlapping and misaligned with the administrative unit defining the spatial domain of interest (e.g., a state or province). Consequently, some species display differentially restricted extents within a study area. Assuming hard boundaries based on expert opinion or published range maps to restrict species occurrence predictions implies a false sense of certainty in model-based inferences. We propose a multi-species occupancy model with a spatial Gaussian process on site-specific effects for each species as a model-based solution. Specifying informative Bayesian hyperpriors on the spatial hyperparameters encapsulates broad-scale correlation among site occupancy probabilities for each species. We fit this model to acoustic detection/nondetection data collected with autonomous recording units during summer of 2016\textendash 2019 throughout Oregon and Washington, USA, on 15 bat species. We found vast improvements in spatial predictions of spotted bat (Euderma maculatum), canyon bat (Parastrellus hesperus), and Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) when the available environmental predictors were insufficient for characterizing their restricted ranges within the region. In contrast, widespread species (Lasionycteris noctivagans, Myotis californicus, Myotis evotis, Myotis volans) were appropriately modeled using only environmental predictors, such as percentage forest cover and cliff and canyon cover. Utilizing spatial Gaussian processes within a community or multi-species model incorporates uncertainty in range boundaries and allows for simultaneous predictions for the entire faunal assemblage even if species have nonoverlapping or restricted ranges within a spatial domain of interest. Such modeling improvements are essential if species distribution models are to accurately inform monitoring, species recovery plans, and other conservation efforts.},

These noncompliance behaviors partly reflect people's concerns for the inherent costs of social distancing while discounting its public health benefits. We propose that this oversight may be associated with the limitation in one's mental capacity to simultaneously retain multiple pieces of information in working memory (WM) for rational decision making that leads to social-distancing compliance. We tested this hypothesis in 850 United States residents during the first 2 wk following the presidential declaration of national emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that participants' social-distancing compliance at this initial stage could be predicted by individual differences in WM capacity, partly due to increased awareness of benefits over costs of social distancing among higher WM capacity individuals. Critically, the unique contribution of WM capacity to the individual differences in social-distancing compliance could not be explained by other psychological and socioeconomic factors (e.g., moods, personality, education, and income levels). Furthermore, the critical role of WM capacity in social-distancing compliance can be generalized to the compliance with another set of rules for social interactions, namely the fairness norm, in Western cultures. Collectively, our data reveal contributions of a core cognitive process underlying social-distancing compliance during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting a potential cognitive venue for developing strategies to mitigate a public health crisis.}

Temporal complexity is often investigated in a syntactic framework focusing on the statistical features of symbolic song sequences. Alternatively, temporal patterns can be investigated in a rhythmic framework that focuses on the relative timing between song elements. Here, we investigate the merits of combining both frameworks by integrating syntactic and rhythmic analyses of Australian pied butcherbird (Cracticus nigrogularis) songs, which exhibit organized syntax and diverse rhythms. We show that rhythms of the pied butcherbird song bouts in our sample are categorically organized and predictable by the song's first-order sequential syntax. These song rhythms remain categorically distributed and strongly associated with the first-order sequential syntax even after controlling for variance in note length, suggesting that the silent intervals between notes induce a rhythmic structure on note sequences. We discuss the implication of syntactic\textendash rhythmic relations as a relevant feature of song complexity with respect to signals such as human speech and music, and advocate for a broader conception of song complexity that takes into account syntax, rhythm, and their interaction with other acoustic and perceptual features.},

  abstract = {Many human interactions involve pieces of information being passed from one person to another, raising the question of how this process of information transmission is affected by the cognitive capacities of the agents involved. Bartlett (1932) explored the influence of memory biases on the "serial reproduction" of information, in which one person's reconstruction of a stimulus from memory becomes the stimulus seen by the next person. These experiments were done using relatively uncontrolled stimuli, but suggested that serial reproduction could transform information in a way that reflected the biases inherent in memory. We formally analyze serial reproduction using a Bayesian model of reconstruction from memory, giving a general result characterizing the effect of memory biases on information transmission. We then test the predictions of this account in four experiments using simple one-dimensional stimuli. Our results provide theoretical and empirical justification for the idea that serial reproduction reflects memory biases. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

One force is analogous to selection, and acts on differences in the fitness of aspects of culture by influencing who people choose to learn from. Another force is analogous to mutation, and influences how culture changes over time owing to errors in learning and the effects of cognitive biases. Which of these forces need to be appealed to in explaining any particular aspect of human cul- tures is an open question. We present a study that explores this question empirically, examining the role that the cognitive biases that influence cultural transmission might play in universals of colour naming. In a large-scale labora- tory experiment, participants were shown labelled examples from novel artificial systems of colour terms and were asked to classify other colours on the basis of those examples. The responses of eachparticipantwereusedto gen- erate the examples seen by subsequent participants. By simulating cultural transmission in the laboratory, we were able to isolate a single evolutionary forcethe effects of cognitive biases, analogous to mutationand examine its consequences. Our results show that this process produces convergence towards systems of colour terms similar to those seen across human languages, providingsupport for the conclusionthat the effects of cognitive biases, brought out through cultural transmission, can account for universals in colour naming.},

A cross-sectional study was conducted among Japanese college students, measuring psychosocial stress levels by means of IMPS (The Inventory to Measure Psychosocial Stress). A total of 264 female students (mean age 19.4 years), who were invited to participate in the study in October 2007, completed the questionnaire, which dealt with anthropometric data, lifestyle, menstrual history, and menstrual health status. Forty-three students were excluded due to missing data, and the remaining 221 were analyzed. The proportions of students who reported premenstrual symptoms, menstrual pain, and the experience of irregular menstrual cycles were 79\%, 79\%, and 63\%, respectively. Students who reported premenstrual symptoms, menstrual pain, and the experience of irregular menstrual cycles had higher stress scores than those who did not. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent factors associated with having premenstrual symptoms, menstrual pain, and the experience of irregular menstrual cycles. Stress score, heavy menstrual flow, and menstrual pain were significant predictors for premenstrual symptoms, while age at menarche and having premenstrual symptoms were significant predictors for menstrual pain. Both stress score and body mass index were found to be significant predictors for having experienced irregular menstrual cycles. The results suggest that psychosocial stress is independently associated with premenstrual symptoms and the experience of irregular menstrual cycles among college students, implying that changes in the functional potentiality of women as a result of stress are related with changes in their menstrual function.},

Socioeconomic correlates between wealth and cognitive functions have been well established in behavioral studies. However, functional and structural brain correlates of SES remain unclear. Here, we sought to uncover the most likely neural regions to be affected by low SES, specifically associated with age. Using effect size\textendash seed-based d Mapping, we compiled studies that examined individuals with low SES and performed functional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry meta-analyses. The results revealed that as from early to late age, individuals exposed to low SES are less likely to have sustained executive network activity yet a greater likelihood to enhanced activity within reward-related regions. A similar activity was shown for gray matter volume across early to older age. These findings provide the first quantitative integration of neuroimaging results pertaining to the neural basis of SES. Hypoactivation of the executive network and hyperactivation of the reward network in low SES individuals may support the scarcity hypothesis and animal models of the effects of early adversity.}

We find that oblique learning (learning from unrelated individual of the previous generation) and maternal learning mask sexual selection and therefore do not allow the maintenance of divergence. In contrast, by enhancing positive frequency-dependent sexual selection, paternal learning can maintain more divergence than genetic inheritance, but leads to the loss of polymorphism more easily. Furthermore, paternal learning inhibits the invasion of a novel self-referent phenotype-matching trait, especially in a large population.},

This can happen because, for example, media may store information together making it more likely to be transmitted together, or through cognitive mechanisms such as causal reasoning. Evolutionary biology suggests that physical linkage of genes (being on the same chromosome) allows neutral and maladaptive genes to spread by hitchhiking on adaptive genes, while the pairwise difference between neutral genes is unaffected. Whether packaging may lead to similar dynamics in cultural evolution is unclear. To understand the effect of cultural packages on cultural evolutionary dynamics, we built an agent-based simulation that allows links to form and break between cultural traits. During transmission, one trait and others that are directly or indirectly connected to it are transmitted together in a package.We compare variation in cultural traits between different rates of link formation and breakage and find that an intermediate frequency of links can lower cultural diversity, which can be misinterpreted as a signature of payoff bias or conformity. Further, cultural hitchhiking can occur when links are common.},

Symptoms are often mild, but can be severe enough to substantially affect daily activities. About 5-8\% of women thus suffer from severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS); most of these women also meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Mood and behavioural symptoms, including irritability, tension, depressed mood, tearfulness, and mood swings, are the most distressing, but somatic complaints, such as breast tenderness and bloating, can also be problematic. We outline theories for the underlying causes of severe PMS, and describe two main methods of treating it: one targeting the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis, and the other targeting brain serotonergic synapses. Fluctuations in gonadal hormone levels trigger the symptoms, and thus interventions that abolish ovarian cyclicity, including long-acting analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or oestradiol (administered as patches or implants), effectively reduce the symptoms, as can some oral contraceptives. The effectiveness of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, taken throughout the cycle or during luteal phases only, is also well established. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

The aim of the current study was to determine whether drum breaks are culturally transmitted through musical collaboration networks, and to identify the factors driving the evolution of these networks. Using network-based diffusion analysis we found strong evidence for the cultural transmission of drum breaks via collaboration between artists, and identified several demographic variables that bias transmission. Additionally, using network evolution methods we found evidence that the structure of the collaboration network is no longer biased by geographic proximity after the year 2000, and that gender disparity has relaxed over the same period. Despite the delocalization of communities by the internet, collaboration remains a key transmission mode of music sampling traditions. The results of this study provide valuable insight into how demographic biases shape cultural transmission in complex networks, and how the evolution of these networks has shifted in the digital age.},

Previous studies in music have revealed that frequency-based bias (e.g. conformity and novelty) drives large-scale cultural diversity in different ways across domains and levels of analysis. Music sampling is an ideal research model for this process because samples are known to be culturally transmitted between collaborating artists, and sampling events are reliably documented in online databases. The aim of the current study was to determine whether frequency-based bias has played a role in the cultural transmission of music sampling traditions, using a longitudinal dataset of sampling events across three decades. Firstly, we assessed whether turn-over rates of popular samples differ from those expected under neutral evolution. Next, we used agent-based simulations in an approximate Bayesian computation framework to infer what level of frequency-based bias likely generated the observed data. Despite anecdotal evidence of novelty bias, we found that sampling patterns at the population-level are most consistent with conformity bias. We conclude with a discussion of how counter-dominance signalling may reconcile individual cases of novelty bias with population-level conformity.},

The PCS workflow uses predictability as a reality check and considers the importance of computation in data collection/storage and algorithm design. It augments predictability and computability with an overarching stability principle. Stability expands on statistical uncertainty considerations to assess how human judgment calls impact data results through data and model/algorithm perturbations. As part of the PCS workflow, we develop PCS inference procedures, namely PCS perturbation intervals and PCS hypothesis testing, to investigate the stability of data results relative to problem formulation, data cleaning, modeling decisions, and interpretations. We illustrate PCS inference through neuroscience and genomics projects of our own and others. Moreover, we demonstrate its favorable performance over existing methods in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in high-dimensional, sparse linear model simulations, including a wide range of misspecified models. Finally, we propose PCS documentation based on R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook, with publicly available, reproducible codes and narratives to back up human choices made throughout an analysis. The PCS workflow and documentation are demonstrated in a genomics case study available on Zenodo.}

To answer these questions, this study conducted a large scale cross language investigation into Zipf's law. The statistical results show that Zipf's laws in 50 languages all share a 3-segment structural pattern, with each segment demonstrating distinctive linguistic properties and the lower segment invariably bending downwards to deviate from theoretical expectation. This finding indicates that this deviation is a fundamental and universal feature of word frequency distributions in natural languages, not the statistical error of low frequency words. A computer simulation based on the dual-process theory yields Zipf's law with the same structural pattern, suggesting that Zipf's law of natural languages are motivated by common cognitive mechanisms. These results show that Zipf's law in languages is motivated by cognitive mechanisms like dual-processing that govern human verbal behaviors.},

Experimental designs, however, often do not consider how individuals evaluate and compare the available options, which may affect the results significantly. Preferences are often assumed to be absolute, with individuals assigning a fixed, absolute value to a cue or potential partner they encounter. However, individuals may instead also compare the available options, in which case the social context plays an essential role in the preference for each potential partner. Here we investigated the importance of considering the choosers' evaluation process in mate preference tests. Using a mate preference study on wild great tit, {$<$}em{$>$}Parus major{$<$}/em{$>$}, heterozygosity, breast stripe size and yellowness as a case study, we tested whether individuals use absolute or comparative mate preferences. We analysed how the perceived average attractiveness and the variation in attractiveness of the group of potential mates affected the measured preference functions. We found that the average attractiveness of the stimulus groups affected the total time individuals spent visiting all stimulus birds, and that the variation in attractiveness within groups affected the measured preference slopes. This indicates that the social context will affect the measured responses to stimulus groups, and that great tits may use both absolute and comparative evaluation. Considering how a study species encounters and evaluates potential mates and how the social environment may affect preferences is essential when choosing an appropriate experimental design to obtain reliable measurements of mate preferences. We therefore strongly advise future studies to consider not only the absolute stimulus trait values, but also the context in which they are presented. The ability to quantify preferences accurately will increase our understanding of mate preferences, mate choice and ultimately sexual selection.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Our understanding of bird song, a model system for animal communication and the neurobiology of learning, depends critically on making reliable, validated comparisons between the complex multidimensional syllables that are used in songs. However, most assessments of song similarity are based on human inspection of spectrograms, or computational methods developed from human intuitions. Using a novel automated operant conditioning system, we collected a large corpus of zebra finches' (Taeniopygia guttata) decisions about song syllable similarity. We use this dataset to compare and externally validate similarity algorithms in widely-used publicly available software (Raven, Sound Analysis Pro, Luscinia). Although these methods all perform better than chance, they do not closely emulate the avian assessments. We then introduce a novel deep learning method that can produce perceptual similarity judgements trained on such avian decisions. We find that this new method outperforms the established methods in accuracy and more closely approaches the avian assessments. Inconsistent (hence ambiguous) decisions are a common occurrence in animal behavioural data; we show that a modification of the deep learning training that accommodates these leads to the strongest performance. We argue this approach is the best way to validate methods to compare song similarity, that our dataset can be used to validate novel methods, and that the general approach can easily be extended to other species.},

  abstract = {Songs from 402 Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis) were sampled in order to describe the structure of the song phrase and the relationship of its elements to the call repertoire. The song of wild birds was also compared to that of 47 domesticated Zebra Finches from two European laboratories in order to examine the effects of domestication on song structure. The stereotyped phrase, which is the repetitive unit of the song, had a mean number of 6.75 elements and a mean duration of 0.86 s in wild birds. Elements were sung in sequence that defined three parts to the phrase-a start, a middle and an end. Fourteen types of elements were identified of which four were sung by the vast majority of males; three of these "primary" elements were "borrowed" unmodified from the call repertoire, and formed the start and end sections of the phrase. "Secondary" elements, which were less frequently represented across males, constituted the middle of the phrase and appeared to be modified versions of the Distance-call Element, the loudest element in the phrase. I tentatively conclude that Zebra Finch song may have evolved from the calls associated with flight intention and take-off. Domestication has led to changes in element morphology, frequency of occurrence, and rate of singing (elements/s), but not in number of elements per phrase.},

Evolutionary biologists, however, have been slow to turn to anthropology for insights about evolution. Recently, evolutionary biology has been engaged in a debate over the need to revise evolutionary theory to account for developments made in 60 years since the Modern Synthesis, the standard evolutionary paradigm, was framed. Revision proponents maintain these developments challenge central tenets of standard theory that can only be accounted for in an extended evolutionary synthesis (EES). Anthropology has much to offer to this debate. One important transition in human cultural evolution, the domestication of plants and animals, provides an ideal model system assessing core EES assumptions about directionality, causality, targets of selection, modes of inheritance, and pace of evolution. In so doing, anthropologists contribute to an overarching framework that brings together cultural and biological evolution.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

During the first nine seconds of the trial subjects moved with full vision and were paced by a metronome. During the latter 15 seconds, vision could be removed and/or the pacing signal could be removed. There were no effects of the pacing signal on the temporal and spatial characteristics of the circle. Withdrawal of vision did not affect the shape of the circle, but did change its sealer quality. The circles became smaller and the center drifted in a systematic fashion. Furthermore, the loss of vision produced an increase in variability in the circle shape, size and location. It is clear that in a simple task such as circle drawing, vision serves not as a source of information about form, but to maintain a stable and consistent form.},

However, an effective, intelligent program for classifying call sequences from numerous recorded sound files is still lacking. Here, we employed three machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Trees) to classify call sequences of social vocalizations of greater horseshoe bats (\emph{Rhinolophus ferrumequinum}) in aggressive and distress contexts. The three machine learning algorithms obtained highly accurate classification rates (Logistic Regression 98\%, SVM 97\% and Decision Trees 96\%). The algorithms also extracted three of the most important features for the classification, the transition between two adjacent syllables, the probability of occurrences of syllables in each position of a sequence, and characteristics of a sequence. The results of statistical analysis also supported the classification of the algorithms. The study provides the first efficient method for data mining of call sequences and the possibility of linguistic parameters in animal communication. It suggests the presence of song-like syntax in the social vocalizations emitted within a non-breeding context in a bat species.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Humans exhibit a high level of vocal plasticity in speech production, which allows us to acquire both native and foreign languages and dialects, and adapt to local accents in social communication. In comparison, non-human primates exhibit limited vocal plasticity, especially in adulthood, which would limit their ability to adapt to different social and environmental contexts in vocal communication. Here, we quantitatively examined the ability of adult common marmosets (\emph{Callithrix jacchus}), a highly vocal New World primate species, to modulate their vocal production in social contexts. While recent studies have demonstrated vocal learning in developing marmosets, we know much less about the extent of vocal learning and plasticity in adult marmosets. We found, in the present study, that marmosets were able to adaptively modify the spectrotemporal structure of their vocalizations when they encountered interfering sounds. Our experiments showed that marmosets shifted the spectrum of their vocalizations away from the spectrum of the interfering sounds in order to avoid the overlap. More interestingly, we found that marmosets made predictive and long-lasting spectral shifts in their vocalizations after they had experienced a particular type of interfering sound. These observations provided evidence for directional control of the vocalization spectrum and long-term vocal plasticity by adult marmosets. The findings reported here have important implications for the ability of this New World primate species in voluntarily and adaptively controlling their vocal production in social communication.}

In this way, the dependence on a large number of target-domain data can be reduced for constructing target learners. Due to the wide application prospects, transfer learning has become a popular and promising area in machine learning. Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning research studies, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey article reviews more than 40 representative transfer learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over 20 representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different data sets, that is, Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31, and the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.},

  abstract = {The evolutionary basis of human female orgasm has been subject to furious scientific debate, which has recently intensified. Many adaptive explanations have been proposed, invoking functions from pair bonding and mate selection to sucking up sperm, but these have been attacked as being based on flawed logic and/or evidence. The popular alternative theory is that female orgasm is not adaptive and is only evolutionarily maintained as a by-product of ongoing selection on the male orgasm-ejaculation system. This theory has not been adequately tested. We tested one of its central tenets: that selection pressure on the male orgasm is partially transmitted to the female via a positive cross-sex correlation in orgasmic function (susceptibility to orgasm in response to sexual stimulation). Using questionnaire data from over 10 000 Finnish twins and siblings, we found significant genetic variation in both male and female orgasmic function, but no significant correlation between opposite-sex twins and siblings. This suggests that different genetic factors underlie male and female orgasmic function and that selection pressures on male orgasmic function do not act substantively on female orgasmic function. These results challenge the by-product theory of female orgasm. ?? 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

The shift to doublet-ending songs first arose west of the Rockies, and has increased immediately east of the Rockies in the last decade. The Ontario population retained predominantly triplet-ending songs. Note lengths have increased over time in all populations, while inter-strophe interval has decreased, allowing doublet-ending birds the ability to have greater strophe repeats for a given song length. We explore whether the emergence and apparent spread of the doublet-ending songs can be explained by cultural drift, or may be under selection by conveying an advantage during counter-singing.},

The relationship between the magnitude of speech elements and their frequency is attributed to the operation of a "law" of linguistic change: that as the frequency of phonemes or of linguistic forms increases, their magnitude decreases. There is thus a tendency to "maintain an equilibrium" between length and frequency, and this tendency rests upon an "underlying law of economy." Human beings strive to maintain an "emotional equilibrium" between variety and repetitiveness of environmental factors and behavior. A speaker's discourse must represent a compromise between variety and repetitiveness adapted to the hearer's "tolerable limits of change in maintaining emotional equilibrium." This accounts for the maintenance of the relationship ab2 = k; the exponent of b expresses this "rate of variegation." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

Age-related decline in vocal quality in humans is known to affect perceived attractiveness by potential mates and voters, but whether such changes have functional implications for nonhuman animals is poorly understood. Most studies of age-related change in animal signals focus on increases in signal quality that occur soon after the age of first breeding ("delayed maturation"), but a few have shown that signal quality declines in older individuals after a mid-life peak ("behavioral senescence"). Whether other individuals are able to detect this senescent decline of assessment signals has not previously been tested. Here we use playback experiments to show that wild male swamp sparrows ({$<$}em{$>$}Melospiza georgiana{$<$}/em{$>$}) respond more aggressively to songs from 2-year-old males as compared with songs from the same males when they are 10 years old. Senescence in signals that, like birdsong, affect reproductive success through intrasexual competition or mate choice may be of evolutionary significance.}

Receivers in turn may benefit from assessing a signaler's age, even in cases where their doing so is against the signaler's interests. Indicators of age contained in signals thus may have important fitness consequences for both signalers and receivers. In birds, males of many species have been shown to display delayed maturation of their songs, resulting in older males singing songs that are higher in quality in one or more characteristics. Conversely, it seems possible that songs might eventually deteriorate with age as an aspect behavioral senescence. Studies of birdsong long enough to test both possibilities are quite uncommon, with nearly all studies aspect of age-dependent changes in birdsong spanning 3 or fewer years of males' lives. Here, we present the longest longitudinal analysis of male birdsong to date, in which we analyze songs recorded for 4\textendash 11 years of the lives of captive male swamp sparrows. We find that males displayed delayed maturation of three song characteristics: song rate, song length, and consistency between songs. Delayed maturation was followed by behavioral senescence of three characteristics: song rate, stereotypy within songs, and consistency between songs. Because song quality declined in males beyond 2 years of age, this evidence is inconsistent with a signaling system in which females both prefer increasingly older males and are able to accurately determine male age through song assessment. Rather, our evidence suggests that swamp sparrows should be able to use song to distinguish intermediate-aged males from 1-year-old and very old males.},

  doi = {S0003347218300101},
  abstract = {The oscine passerines, an avian suborder that comprises almost half of all bird species worldwide, learn their song primarily through cultural transmission. As the world's forests become increasingly fragmented and the population sizes of many forest-dwelling species decline, there may be increasingly restricted opportunities for the transmission of cultural information. However, the effects of forest fragmentation on birdsong have not been well documented. In this paper, we examine the relationship between forest fragment size and song characteristics for two forest bird species, an oscine passerine (orange-billed sparrow, {$<$}italic{$>$}Arremon aurantiirostris{$<$}/italic{$>$}) that learns its song culturally, and a suboscine passerine (scale-crested pygmy tyrant, {$<$}italic{$>$}Lophotriccus pileatus{$<$}/italic{$>$}) that does not. Recordings were taken from individuals in 12 premontane wet forest fragments ranging in size from approximately 1.4{$<$}hsp sp="0.25"/{$>$}ha\textendash 360{$<$}hsp sp="0.25"/{$>$}ha in southern Costa Rica. As predicted under the `cultural erosion' hypothesis, we found that acoustic characteristics associated with song complexity such as the number of syllables per song and song duration decreased with decreasing fragment size for the oscine but not for the suboscine species. This study supports the idea that learned cultural elements are sensitive to fragment size and that cultural diversity should be considered along with other forms of biodiversity in the conservation of social learning species.},

  doi = {10.1111/jeb.13908},
  abstract = {There is considerable debate about the occurrence of assortative mating between phenotypic traits measured within natural populations. Meta-analyses have implied that assortative mating occurs generally in natural populations but recent work indicates these conclusions largely result from biased data. Specifically, estimates of phenotypic correlations between mating partners do not solely result from non-random associations between individual-level traits of partners but also from other biological processes (joint phenotypic plasticity, indirect genetic effects), methodological practices (observer bias), and other unexplained residual correlations (e.g. correlated measurement error). This paper puts this critique to test. First, we estimated the overall phenotypic correlation between phenotypic traits of mating partners for a wild population of great tits. Second, we estimated various key variance components to reveal the extent to which phenotypic correlations between partners resulted from assortative mating, reversible plasticity, social partner effects, and methodological practices. We performed our analyses for a range of phenotypic traits (body mass, breathing rate, exploration behaviour, wing and tarsus length) to derive general conclusions not hinging on the specifics of the traits involved. Our analyses support the conclusion that patterns of assortative mating exist at first glance but occur because of the biasing effects of correlated residuals likely caused by a combination of phenotypic responses to unknown environmental factors or measurement error \textendash{} not because of intrinsic patterns of assortative mating.}

  doi = {10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.07.006},
  abstract = {Vocal communication is often used to signal willingness to escalate into a physical fight during territorial conflicts. In songbirds, starting to sing when an opponent already sings (song overlapping) has been suggested to signal aggressive intent (willingness to escalate). We used a multiyear data set to test whether song overlapping predicts aggressiveness in great tits,   Parus major  . Territorial males were subjected twice to a simulated territorial intrusion when their mate was in the egg-laying phase, and twice when she was incubating. Males were presented with a taxidermic mount and a noninteractive playback of a conspecific song near their nestbox. The experiment was conducted over 3 consecutive years, resulting in repeated measures for males that bred across multiple years. The estimated minimum approach distance to the intruder, a repeatable and heritable trait that predicts the likelihood of physical attack, was used as a measure of aggression. We determined the duration of song overlapping by the focal male relative to values expected by chance. Against expectations, we found that birds that overlapped were less (rather than more) aggressive. In addition, variance partitioning demonstrated that this link resulted from a within-individual effect: when birds became less aggressive from one observation to the next, they also overlapped more. There was no among-individual effect: individuals that were on average more aggressive did not, on average, overlap either more or less than others. Our results thus imply that song overlapping is linked to aggression but opposite to expectations, and not among individuals. Furthermore, the majority of birds overlapped at or below chance levels. Overall, song overlapping may not signal aggressive intent but rather 'nonengagement', or result from interference avoidance, allowing aggressive residents to better hear an intruder's acoustic output during territorial intrusions.}

Despite the high species richness of the Neotropical avifauna, vocal repertoire sizes and the function of vocalizations of species remain poorly documented compared to species from the North-temperate zone. We present the first qualitative and quantitative description of the vocal repertoire, diel variation in vocal activity and song-type sharing of the Gray-browed Brushfinch (  Arremon assimilis  ), an Andean understory songbird, based on recordings of vocalizations obtained for 33 territorial pairs from the Colombian Andes. We found that   A. assimilis   produces four types of calls, solo songs emitted separately by individuals of each sex, and duets. By classifiying 7830 songs, we estimated that males have on average 9.6\,{$\pm$}\,1.9 song types involving high-pitched, modulated elements combined in various ways. Similarity in repertoire-use declined with distance between neighbors to the point that no song types were shared among individuals located in sectors separated by only 2~km. Vocal activity peaked in the early morning for calls and male songs, whereas calls showed an additional peak near dusk. Our results provide the first evidence of female solo song and duets in   A. assimilis  , which are seemingly rare behaviors among Neotropical sparrows.

  abstract = {Birdsong has been the subject of broad research from a variety of sub-disciplines and has taught us much about the evolution, function, and mechanisms driving animal communication and cognition. Typically, birdsong refers to the specialized vocalizations produced by oscines. Historically, much of the research on birdsong was conducted in north temperate regions (specifically in Europe and North America) leading to multiple biases. Due to these historic biases these vocalizations are generally considered to be highly sexually dimorphic, heavily shaped by sexual selection and essential for courtship and territoriality. Song is also typically defined as a learned trait shaped by cultural evolution. Together, this framework focuses research specifically on males, particularly during the north temperate breeding season \textendash{} reflecting and thereby reinforcing this framework. The physiological underpinnings of song often emphasize the role of the hypothalamic\textendash pituitary\textendash gonadal axis (associated with breeding changes) and the song control system (underlying vocal learning). Over the years there has been great debate over which features of song are essential to the definition of birdsong, which features apply broadly to contexts outside males in the north temperate region, and over the importance of having a definition at all. Importantly, the definitions we use can both guide and limit the progress of research. Here, we describe the history of these definitions, and how these definitions have directed and restricted research to focus on male song in sexually selected contexts. Additionally, we highlight the gaps in our scientific knowledge, especially with respect to the function and physiological mechanisms underlying song in females and in winter, as well as in non-seasonally breeding species. Furthermore, we highlight the problems with using complexity and learning as dichotomous variables to categorize songs and calls. Across species, no one characteristic of song \textendash{} sexual dimorphism, seasonality, complexity, sexual selection, learning \textendash{} consistently delineates song from other songbird vocal communication. We provide recommendations for next steps to build an inclusive information framework that will allow researchers to explore nuances in animal communication and promote comparative research. Specifically, we recommend that researchers should operationalize the axis of variation most relevant to their study/species by identifying their specific question and the variable(s) of focus (e.g. seasonality). Researchers should also identify the axis (axes) of variation (e.g. degree of control by testosterone) most relevant to their study and use language consistent with the question and axis (axes) of variation (e.g. control by testosterone in the seasonal vocal production of birds).}

We evaluated this layer on speech activity detection, speaker verification, urban sound classification, and zebra finch call type classification. We found that models based on learnable STRFs are on par for all tasks with state-of-the-art and obtain the best performance for speech activity detection. As this layer remains a Gabor filter, it is fully interpretable. Thus, we used quantitative measures to describe distribution of the learned spectro-temporal modulations. Filters adapted to each task and focused mostly on low temporal and spectral modulations. The analyses show that the filters learned on human speech have similar spectro-temporal parameters as the ones measured directly in the human auditory cortex. Finally, we observed that the tasks organized in a meaningful way: the human vocalization tasks closer to each other and bird vocalizations far away from human vocalizations and urban sounds tasks.}

The neural mechanisms allowing the auditory system to generate predictions that override ascending sensory information remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) exhibits auditory restoration of conspecific song both in a behavioral task and in neural recordings from the equivalent of auditory cortex. Decoding the responses of a population of single units to occluded songs reveals the spectrotemporal structure of the missing syllables. Surprisingly, restoration occurs under anesthesia and for songs that the bird has not heard. These results show that an internal model of the general structure of conspecific vocalizations can bias sensory processing without attention.}

Female birds are sensitive to inter- and intra-species song variation. Some aspects of female song preference depend on developmental experiences. For example, in Bengalese finches and zebra finches, adult females prefer the song to which they were exposed early in life, such as the fathers song. However, it is unclear whether such song preference in females is sexually motivated. The purpose of our study is to test if female Bengalese finches recognize their fathers song as sexually attractive. We measured copulation solicitation displays during playbacks of the fathers song vs. unfamiliar conspecific songs and found that across individuals, the fathers song elicited more displays than other songs. In addition, we analyzed if a birds response to a given song could be predicted by the level of similarity of that song to the fathers song. The results suggest that preference for the fathers song in this species is actually relevant to mate choice. Although more precise control is necessary in future studies to elucidate the process of preference development, our results imply the significance of early-life experience in shaping female song preference.}

However, song parameters did not correlate with hue and chroma of the yellow breast coloration, supporting the idea that they convey different units of information.

Menzerath's law is hypothesized to reflect efficiency in          information transfer, but biases and constraints in motor production can also lead          to this pattern. We investigated the evolutionary breadth of ML and the contribution          of production mechanisms to ML in the songs of 15 songbird species. Negative relationships          between the number and duration of constituents (e.g., syllables in phrases) were          observed in all 15 species. However, negative relationships were also observed in          null models in which constituents were randomly allocated into observed element durations,          and the observed negative relationship for numerous species did not differ from the          null model; consequently, ML in these species could simply reflect production constraints          and not communicative efficiency. By contrast, ML was significantly different from          the null model for more than half the cases, suggesting additional organizational          rules are imposed onto birdsongs.

  abstract = {In songbirds, learning to sing is a highly social process that likely involves social reward. Here, we hypothesized that the degree to which a juvenile songbird learns a song depends on the degree to which it finds that song rewarding to hear during vocal development. We tested this hypothesis by measuring song preferences in young birds during song learning and then analyzing their adult songs. Song preferences were measured in an operant key-pressing assay. Juvenile male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) had access to two keys, each of which was associated with a higher likelihood of playing the song of their father or that of another familiar adult ("neighbor"). To minimize the effects of exposure on learning, we implemented a reinforcement schedule that allowed us to detect preferences while balancing exposure to each song. On average, the juveniles significantly preferred the father's song early during song learning, before they were themselves singing. At around post-hatch day 60, their preference shifted to the neighbor's song. At the end of the song learning period, we recorded the juveniles' songs and compared them to the father's and the neighbor's song. All of the birds copied father's song. The accuracy with which the father's song was imitated was positively correlated with the peak strength of the preference for the father's song during the sensitive period. Our results show that preference for a social stimulus, in this case a vocalization, predicted social learning during development.}

Consistent with contingent evolution in song, we found lower phylogenetic signal for the sound frequency of songs than calls, which suggests faster and less predictable evolution, and found unpredictable direction of evolution in lineages with longer songs, which presumably experience stronger sexual selection on song. Nonetheless, the most important deterministic pattern of sound frequency evolution\textemdash its negative association with body size\textemdash was stronger in songs than calls. This can be explained by songs being longer-range signals than most calls, and thus using sound frequencies that animals of a given size produce best at high amplitude. Results indicate that sexual selection can increase aspects of evolutionary contingency while strengthening, rather than weakening, deterministic patterns of evolution.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Social learning of vocalizations is integral to song inheritance in oscine passerines. However, other factors, such as genetic inheritance and the developmental environment, can also influence song phenotype. The relative contributions of these factors can have a strong influence on song evolution and may affect important evolutionary processes such as speciation. However, relative contributions are well-described only for a few species and are likely to vary with taxonomy. Using archived song data, we examined patterns of song inheritance in a domestic population of Java sparrows (\emph{Lonchura oryzivora}), some of which had been cross-fostered. Six-hundred and seventy-six songs from 73 birds were segmented and classified into notes and note subtypes (\emph{N} = 22,972), for which a range of acoustic features were measured. Overall, we found strong evidence for cultural inheritance of song structure and of the acoustic characteristics of notes; sons' song syntax and note composition were similar to that of their social fathers and were not influenced by genetic relatedness. For vocal consistency of note subtypes, a measure of vocal performance, there was no apparent evidence of social or genetic inheritance, but both age and developmental environment influenced consistency. These findings suggest that high learning fidelity of song material, i.e., song structure and note characteristics, could allow novel variants to be preserved and accumulate over generations, with implications for evolution and conservation. However, differences in vocal performance do not show strong links to cultural inheritance, instead potentially serving as condition dependent signals.}

  journal = {Behavioral Ecology},
  doi = {10.1093/beheco/araa139},
  abstract = {Changes in signaling repertoires across species allow for insight into the macroevolutionary forces that control signaling systems. Signaling systems are theorized to be affected by both the social and ecological environments of species. With respect to social variables, increased social complexity is thought to lead to increased vocal complexity. Although ecology can affect signaling systems in numerous ways, one potential effect of ecology is that more cluttered habitats should lead to greater reliance on nonvisual (e.g., vocal) signals. To test these concepts on a macroevolutionary scale, we compiled a large dataset of avian vocal repertoires. We amassed vocal repertoires for 821 species of birds and for many of these species categorized their vocalizations into usage categories (e.g., alarm, contact). To analyze the social and ecological forces that act on repertoire evolution, we incorporated datasets with several social variables (e.g., cooperative breeding and length of social bond), and included data on the habitat and foraging behaviors of species within the dataset. We used Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to test for potential relationships within the data. We found that cooperative breeding was a significant predictor of larger repertoire size in birds; we also find several, more targeted effects. For instance, foraging strata affected repertoire size and repertoire composition. In sum, we find considerable evidence that social features affect repertoire size while certain ecological variables have more targeted effects on vocal repertoires.}

  abstract = {In blue petrels (\emph{Halobaena caerulea}), females are supposed to be particularly choosy and mate choice can take a couple of years. In these lifelong monogamous seabirds, choosing a good mate is crucial and has a strong influence on their fitness. Due to their nocturnal habits, the absence of sexual dimorphism, and the physical barrier between males calling from their burrow and females flying above the colony, vocal signals seem to be one of the main channels for males to communicate with potential mates. In a previous study, we investigated whether acoustic parameters of male calls carry information about morphological characteristics that might be indicators of males' qualities. Here, we experimentally test whether these acoustic parameters linked to male characteristics are actually attractive to females. To do so, we played back modified calls of males to females in a colony of blue petrels of the Kerguelen archipelago. We found that flying females were more attracted by high-pitched calls, and by calls broadcasted at a high call rate. Previous studies showed a relationship between pitch and bill depth and length. In filter-feeding birds, such as blue petrels, bill morphology influences feeding efficiency. A high call rate is an indicator of sexual motivation and makes the caller easier to locate by potential mates and predators in the hubbub of the colony. We thus hypothesized that producing frequent high-pitched calls appeared to be preferable for a conspicuous sexual signaling although it may increase predation risks.}

  abstract = {It has often been observed that birds sing at a higher pitch in cities and other areas that are polluted with intense low-frequency noise. How this pattern arises remains unclear though. One prevailing idea is that songbirds adjust song frequencies to environmental noise profiles through developmental plasticity via vocal learning. However, the conclusions of previous studies testing this hypothesis are inconsistent. Here we report the findings from two song learning experiments with zebra finches (\emph{Taenopygia guttata}), in which we exposed young birds to anthropogenic noise during their sensitive vocal learning period. Unlike previous studies that addressed this issue, we did not use constant synthetic noise but natural urban noise with its typical amplitude fluctuations that was broadcast at realistic sound levels. We found that noise-exposed males in neither experiment developed higher pitched songs compared to control males. This suggests that the natural fluctuations between higher and lower noise levels in cities may allow young birds to exploit relatively quiet moments to hear their tutors and themselves, permitting them to make accurate copies of even low-frequency song elements.}

Zipf's Law of least effort has been used to assess the potential information content of animal repertoires, including whether or not a particular animal communication could be "language-like". As all human languages follow Zipf's law, with a power law coefficient (PLC) close to -1, animal signals with similar probability distributions are postulated to possess similar information characteristics to language. However, estimation of the PLC from limited empirical datasets (e.g. most animal communication studies) is problematic because of biases from small sample sizes.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}2. The traditional approach to estimating Zipf's law PLC is to find the slope of a log-log rank-frequency plot.

Here, we test whether an entropy approach yields more robust estimates of Zipf's law PLC than the traditional approach.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}3. We examined the efficacy of the entropy approach in two ways. First, we estimated the PLC from synthetic data sets generated with \emph{a priori} known power law probability distributions. This revealed that the estimated PLC using the traditional method is particularly inaccurate for highly stereotyped sequences, even at modest repertoire sizes. Estimation via Shannon entropy is accurate with modest sample sizes even for repertoires with thousands of distinct elements. Second, we applied these approaches to empirical data taken from 11 animal species. Shannon entropy produced a more robust estimate of PLC with lower variance than the traditional method, even when the true PLC is unknown. Our approach for the first time reveals Zipf's law operating in the vocal systems of multiple lineages: songbirds, hyraxes, and cetaceans.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}4. As different methods of estimating the PLC can lead to misleading results in real data, estimating the balance of a communication system between simplicity and complexity is best performed using the entropy approach.

  abstract = {Statistical learning and probabilistic prediction are fundamental processes in auditory cognition. A prominent computational model of these processes is Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM), a variable-order Markov model that learns by internalizing {$<$}em{$>$}n{$<$}/em{$>$}-grams from training sequences. However, PPM has limitations as a cognitive model: in particular, it has a perfect memory that weights all historic observations equally, which is inconsistent with memory capacity constraints and recency effects observed in human cognition. We address these limitations with PPM-Decay, a new variant of PPM that introduces a customizable memory decay kernel. In three studies\textemdash one with artificially generated sequences, one with chord sequences from Western music, and one with new behavioral data from an auditory pattern detection experiment\textemdash we show how this decay kernel improves the model's predictive performance for sequences whose underlying statistics change over time, and enables the model to capture effects of memory constraints on auditory pattern detection. The resulting model is available in our new open-source R package, {$<$}em{$>$}ppm{$<$}/em{$>$} ({$<$}a href="https://github.com/pmcharrison/ppm"{$>$}https://github.com/pmcharrison/ppm{$<$}/a{$>$}). Humans hear a rich variety of sounds throughout everyday life, ranging from the basic (e.g. an alarm clock, a whistling kettle, an ambulance siren) to the complex (e.g. speech, music, birdsong). Understanding these sounds depends on an ability to detect and remember patterns in these sounds, patterns ranging from the two-tone oscillation of the ambulance siren to the classic four-chord progression of Western popular music. A key challenge in audition research is to develop effective computer models of these pattern-detection processes. The Prediction by Partial Matching model is one such model, originally developed for data compression, that learns statistical patterns of varying complexity from sequences of discrete symbols (e.g. 'A, B, A, A, B, A, B'). In previous research this model has proved particularly effective for simulating listeners' responses to music as well as other kinds of auditory sequences. However, the model is an unrealistic simulation of human cognition in that it possesses a perfect memory, unbounded in capacity, where historic events are recalled just as clearly as recent events. In this paper we therefore introduce a memory-decay component to the model, whereby the salience of historic auditory events decreases over time in line with the dynamics of human auditory memory. We present an experiment showing that this memory-decay model provides a natural account of experimental data from an auditory pattern detection task, explaining how human performance deteriorates as a function of the length of the patterns being detected and the speed at which they are played. Conversely, we also present two simulation studies showing that this memory-decay component can improve pattern detection in auditory environments whose statistical structure changes dynamically over time. These studies indicate the potential benefit of incorporating memory constraints into statistical models of auditory pattern detection, and highlight how these memory constraints can both impair and improve pattern detection, depending on the environment.}

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Birds sing mostly to attract partners or to defend territories or resources. In relation to the first function, song can vary with age if older experienced males signal their quality through their vocal output. Regarding the second function, song can also vary with age if singing behavior helps mediate social interactions through repertoire sharing with neighbors. Here, we investigate whether song parameters change with age, and in which direction, in saffron finches \emph{Sicalis flaveola pelzelni}, obligate secondary cavity nesters which produce elaborate melodious songs and show delayed plumage maturation. Cross-sectional comparisons revealed that second year (SY) males sing shorter syllables, and shorter and less versatile songs than older after second year males (ASY), as expected if the latter are more experienced singers. Longitudinal comparisons, which better depict age-related changes, showed that as birds age one year, song length and repertoire size do not change significantly, syllable duration shortens and, as expected for experienced singers, song versatility increases. Correlations between repertoire distance and nesting distance suggest that both SY and ASY males might be adjusting their repertoires to those of ASY neighbors; the former pattern conforms to the expectations if young birds try to emulate the songs of more experienced birds, while the latter is expected if song sharing helps de-escalating antagonistic social interactions amongst males. This research, which provides the first description of song parameters in young second year saffron finches, expands our knowledge of song variation across age classes in songbirds.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}This article is protected by copyright.

However, song parameters did not correlate with hue and chroma of the yellow breast coloration, supporting the idea that they convey different units of information.

Here we present one of the rare studies that tests the influence of demographic variation on social relationships' stability through temporal analysis. Using field data collected on three wild groups of vervet monkeys, {$<$}italic{$>$}Chlorocebus aethiops{$<$}/italic{$>$}, we first analysed the relationships' stability by running correlations between 3-month periods. Then, we investigated how natural demographic variation changed individual centralities (eigenvector) and strength of dyadic relationships within both grooming and proximity networks over a period of 2 years. In vervets, females are philopatric, while males emigrate from their natal group. Thus, we tested whether changes in demography had more influence on network centrality measures and relationship strength in females and their juveniles than in males. Correlations between periods yielded no evidence that predictability of future relationship quality declined with time from current relationship quality. In addition, male immigration was mostly responsible for increases in the core group members' centrality while male emigration had the opposite effect. Regarding dyadic relationships, we found inconsistent patterns that varied with respect to how age/sex and immigration/disappearance affected the network studied (grooming versus proximity). Our findings support the idea that social networks are dynamic structures that vary through time. Similar analyses on other species are needed to investigate which network features emerge as candidates responsible for variation in the complexity with which individuals keep track of relationships.}

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany. Abstract: To provide reliable information about individual-specific characteristics, sexual signals should be consistently displayed within an individual at least within a particular social context or time window. However, some male traits, like bird song, depict extreme within-individual variations even within a very short time frame. To investigate the extent by which acoustic displays in male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) reveal consistent individual-specific attributes or more flexible characteristics, we assessed the repeatability of various song traits at different sampling regimes (within-day, between-day, and between-year contexts). Repertoire size showed considerably high and significant repeatability (R {$>$} 0.25) in all temporal contexts suggesting that it can potentially indicate an individual attribute that is shaped by genetic background, permanent environmental effects, or long-term experience. Song rate, song length, mean frequency and frequency bandwidth, tempo of syllables, and within-song complexity had small-to-moderate repeatability (R {$<$} 0.25) that was significant for the within-day scenario only. Environmental effects can confound repeatability estimates, as males that changed nest boxes between song recordings performed with lower consistency than those that systematically sang on the same territory. Hence, the characteristics of particular songs could reveal aspects that are sensitive to changes in the environment rendering a signal function to the within-individual variance of songs. The consistency of acoustic signals and their sensitivity to the environment determines what kind of information can be conveyed to the receivers. Significance statement: We investigated the repeatability of several song traits in the collared flycatcher to determine signal consistency in different temporal contexts: within days, between days, and between years. We found that repeatability greatly varied across traits, but it generally showed a decreasing tendency as sampling window increased. Repeatability was confounded by effects arising from territory identity, because individuals that changed residency between days sang with less consistency. This result highlights the often-neglected scenario that pseudo-repeatability may arise due to unstandardized environment. In general, our findings imply that the consistency of behaviors and the signal value of song traits may depend on the considered temporal and/or environmental context. The degree of plasticity of acoustic signals determines whether information on a long-term aspect of individual quality or on an immediate state can be conveyed to the receivers.},

Despite methods for automatic analysis, it is still necessary to engage in manual cutting, segmenting and clustering of bird song elements in many cases. Here, we describe a program, the Ficedula Toolbox, which has been made available for free to the bird song research community and has recently come into extensive use. The main advantages of this package are the opportunity to conduct all processing steps in one framework and the option of carrying out computer-aided manual clustering. Output files are ready for further analyses, such as estimation of repertoire size, sequential analysis and repertoire overlap calculation. With this program, findings based on empirical data from the Collared Flycatcher ({$<$}em class="a-plus-plus"{$>$}Ficedula albicollis{$<$}/em{$>$}) song show high inter-observer similarity, and thus, reproducible results. The toolbox may be especially applicable to the analysis of song in species with moderately high repertoires.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {To use vocalizations properly for the estimation of owl population size, it is important to identify how environmental factors affect owl calling behaviour. Here, we analyse how intrinsic and extrinsic factors modify the vocal activity of Tawny Owls Strix aluco in two areas of northern Spain. From March 2013 to May 2015, we radiotracked 20 Tawny Owls and also undertook a systematic survey in which we collected data on spontaneous vocal activity (hoot/call) of the tagged owls, plus their mates and neighbours (36 untagged owls). After 223 nights in Valle de Mena and 224 in Duranguesado we obtained a total of 8791 records of vocal activity. The annual proportion of surveys on which an owl called was 6.3\% and did not differ between the study areas. Vocal activity of Tawny Owls varied with sex, annual cycle stage and weather. Male owls were significantly more vocal than females year-round, and vocal activity peaked during the incubation and post-breeding periods. Wind and rain adversely affected vocal activity of both sexes throughout the year. Tagged owls were detected more often than untagged owls, which we interpret as an observer effect because the systematic survey ensured that short distances to tagged owls increased the probability of detecting vocal activity. In fact, 2.8\% of variation in vocal activity was due to detectability differences between tagged and untagged owls. We conclude that if fieldwork is carried out during the optimum period of the year for vocal detection (i.e. incubation, which in our case was around mid-April), and under good weather conditions (dry and calm nights), censuses based on spontaneous vocal activity would detect only approximately 12\% of the true Tawny Owl population.},

  abstract = {The acoustic properties of vocalizations in common marmosets differ between populations. These differences may be the result of social vocal learning, but they can also result from environmental or genetic differences between populations. We performed translocation experiments to separately quantify the influence of a change in the physical environment (experiment 1), and a change in the social environment (experiment 2) on the acoustic properties of calls from individual captive common marmosets. If population differences were due to genetic differences, we expected no change in the vocalizations of the translocated marmosets. If differences were due to environmental factors, we expected vocalizations to permanently change contingent with environmental changes. If social learning was involved, we expected that the vocalizations of animals translocated to a new population with a different dialect would become more similar to the new population. In experiment 1, we translocated marmosets to a different physical environment without changing the social composition of the groups or their neighbours. Immediately after the translocation to the new facility, one out of three call types showed a significant change in call structure, but 5\textendash 6 weeks later, the calls were no longer different from before the translocation. Thus, the novel physical environment did not induce long lasting changes in the vocalizations of the marmosets. In experiment 2, we translocated marmosets to a new population with a different dialect. Importantly, our previous work had shown that these two populations differed significantly in vocalization structure. The translocated marmosets were still housed in their original social group, but after translocation they were surrounded by the vocalizations from neighbouring groups of the new population. The vocal distance between the translocated individuals and the new population decreased for two out of three call types over 16 weeks. Thus, even without direct social contact or interaction, the vocalizations of the translocated animals converged towards the new population, indicating that common marmosets can modify their calls due to acoustic input from conspecifics alone, via crowd vocal learning. To our knowledge, this is the first study able to distinguish between different explanations for vocal dialects as well as to show crowd vocal learning in a primate species.}
