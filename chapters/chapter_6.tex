\lettrine[lines=2]Bird song captivates human imagination. It has influenced music, literature, and inspired extensive research into its neurobiology, production, and function. Today, the study of bird song is experiencing a renaissance driven by new technological and theoretical tools. Advances in acoustic data collection, signal processing, and machine learning have made it feasible to collect and analyse vast datasets at lower costs. At the same time, insights from cultural evolution theory provide new conceptual tools that are allowing a richer understanding of diversity and variation in bird song, understood as a cultural phenomenon. This thesis tries to take advantage of both and contribute to our understanding of vocal behaviour and cultural dynamics within natural populations of birds. It makes contributions across four areas that are of significance for the research process (chapters 2 and 3) and bird song cultures (chapters 4 and 5).

When I started this project, I, very naively, in hindsight, thought that the methodological tools I would need were available. As I built enclosures for the audio recorders and planned the first field season, I began trying different workflows around existing tools---which was difficult given how little I knew about signal processing and programming---and nothing seemed to be quite right for the task, especially given just how much data I was going to try to collect. It was not planned at first, but as I went on, some of the tools and ideas that I was learning coalesced into a software library, which is now published and has already been used by other researchers. This is introduced in \autoref{chapter:2}. 

I knew that the kinds of questions about cultural change and diversity that I wanted to ask required large amounts of data, beyond what has typically been the case in fields such as behavioural ecology---it is simply difficult to collect lots of high-quality bird songs from individual birds in their natural habitats, so it is rarely done. During approximately nine months in the field, I, with the invaluable help of fantastic masters students Loanne Pichot in 2021 and Antoine Vansse in 2022, collected and later annotated over 100,000 songs from hundreds of birds. As part of this process, I was also lucky to contribute to the collective long-term monitoring effort in Wytham Woods, which involved ringing and measuring traits for around 2,000 great and blue tits over three years. Now, although my personal interests lie in cultural evolution, I know that there are many open research questions---about repeatability and stability, vocal individuality, and the connections between vocal performance, diversity, and fitness, to name a few---where research is hindered by the fact that individual-level datasets of songs from wild birds tend to be small and hard to come by. So, I made publishing all the song data and associated information on individual life histories a priority, hoping that others will benefit from my effort, too. \autoref{chapter:3} consists of a detailed description of the dataset and how I generated it.

Then, I use this extensive dataset to explore two processes, or rather, combinations of processes, influencing cultural change and diversity in animal groups:

The first of these concerns the demographic composition and structure of populations, which, although in a way extrinsic to culture, has been theorised to play a central role in cultural evolution. In \autoref{chapter:4}, I assess the strength of associations between variation in the demographic composition of neighbourhoods and cultural outcomes. I present evidence showing how individual-level differences in repertoire size and diversity can influence emergent group-level cultural dynamics. The results emphasise the need for empirical and modelling studies of cultural change to account for the demographic characteristics of populations, as well as their inherent heterogeneity across time and space: They shape individuals' learning opportunities, and this, in turn, can have large impacts on cultural diversity and turnover.

A second set of processes is intrinsic to the cognitive and motor abilities that support social learning and the formation of cultures. In the preceding chapter we saw that cultural turnover, the progressive replacement of song types, is very high at short temporal scales. And yet, this highly polymorphic culture is stable on larger spatial and temporal scales. In the final chapter, \autoref{chapter:5}, I use ideas from the study of musical and linguistic evolution and find preliminary evidence that, despite their diversity, great tit songs rely on a small number of rhythmic and melodic categories. These categories likely result from motor, information-processing, or perceptual biases, and, paralleling their role in human music, they likely serve to stabilise cultural change---even in the face of high turnover.

\section{Future directions}
The very week I began to get the hang of this and felt like I had learned enough to begin this work---that very same week I found myself facing the thesis submission deadline. That is to say that each of these chapters, and particularly the last two that present empirical findings, feels like an initial exploration. There is ample room for exploration and improvement, and a few clear next steps.

In \autoref{chapter:4}, I developed a method for re-identifying birds based on their songs. This method uses deep metric learning with a visual transformer model and has proven surprisingly effective: It enabled the identification of birds that could not be physically identified but were present in the vocal dataset across different years. Given its practical applications, I intend to conduct more thorough testing and create a more streamlined pipeline to make it accessible to other researchers.

\autoref{chapter:5} is still very much a work in progress. I started thinking about this only recently, but I think it holds some potential. I plan to use data from citizen science platforms to test if rhythmic and melodic structures are stable over very large spatial scales---if they can vary, this would represent evidence that cognitive biases can be socially acquired and evolve culturally---and to develop more formal tests of these ideas.

An early goal of this thesis, which I never had time to fulfil---why does everything always take so much longer than you think, even when you know that things always take much longer than you think?---was to integrate our knowledge about demographic processes in the Wytham great tit population with insights on structural bias in songs within the same modelling framework. This would allow us to estimate how they, together and separately, affect estimates of frequency-dependent learning biases and learning fidelity. Who knows what will come next, and if I will ever get around to doing this, but if you are reading this and are interested, please reach out.\\
