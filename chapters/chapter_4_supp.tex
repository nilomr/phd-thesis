    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/chapter_4/supp_song_sampling.pdf}
    \mycaption{Relationships among outcome variables and sampling effects}{
        (A) Marginal effect of diversity---which describes the proportion of unique songs in a neighbourhood---on novelty, that is, how uncommon, on average, the songs of the birds in a neighbourhood are. These two ways of characterising cultural diversity are (as expected) anti-correlated in our study site due to the effect of sampling: more frequent songs are sampled more readily, causing larger sample sizes (neighbourhoods with more birds and therefore songs) to yield lower average estimates of diversity (C) and higher average estimates of novelty (D), in a nonlinear manner. Once this is adjusted for, diversity and novelty are positively correlated, as expected. (B) Our measure of cultural novelty (y-axis) has the advantages of being continuous and not using an arbitrary cutoff, but is nonetheless correlated with definitions traditionally used in the literature, such as “songs shared by fewer than 4 birds” \parencite{mcgregor1982b}}

        (A) Shows the distribution of the acoustic distances between the same song type sung by the same known bird in different years, in orange, and the minimum pairwise distance between different birds and years. The x-intercept of the vertical line = 0.9. (B) Shows the distribution of the change in distance from the natal nest box to the breeding site in different years for birds that bred more than once. Adult birds have high nest site fidelity, which we used as a further constraint when reidentifying them from their songs.}
